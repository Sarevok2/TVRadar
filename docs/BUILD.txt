REQUIREMENTS FOR BUILDING TV RADAR:

1. Add all .jar files in the lib directory to your class path

2. The resources directory should be in the root directory of your project, or whatever directory you will be running the program from.

3. XMLTV is not included with the source distribution.  To build a windows distribution, Download XMLTV at http://wiki.xmltv.org/index.php/Main_Page and put the xmltv folder into the resources folder.  On Linux XMLTV will need to be installed seperatly.  On most debian based systems like Ubuntu you can run 'apt-get install xmltv'.  Otherwise you can download from the XMLTV web page and install from source.
