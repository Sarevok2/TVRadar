DESCRIPTION
    Output TV listings for Direct TV channels available in Latin America.
    When the grabber was developed it supports listings for the following
    countries: Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador,
    Guatemala, Nicaragua, Panama, Peru, Puerto Rico, Trinidad, Uruguay and
    Venezuela.

    The tv listings comes from http://directstage.directvla.com/ The grabber
    relies on parsing HTML so it might stop working at any time.

    First run tv_grab_dtv_la --configure to choose, first of all your
    country and then which channels you want to download. Then running
    tv_grab_dtv_la with no arguments will output listings in XML format to
    standard output.

    The grabber doesn't generate stop times, so you may want to run tv_sort
    on the output to generate them.

    --configure Prompt for which channels, and write the configuration file.

    --config-file FILE Set the name of the configuration file, the default
    is ~/.xmltv/tv_grab_dtv_la.conf. This is the file written by --configure
    and read when grabbing.

    --gui OPTION Use this option to enable a graphical interface to be used.
    OPTION may be 'Tk', or left blank for the best available choice.
    Additional allowed values of OPTION are 'Term' for normal terminal
    output (default) and 'TermNoProgressBar' to disable the use of
    XMLTV::ProgressBar.

    --output FILE Write to FILE rather than standard output.

    --days N Grab N days. The default is 3.

    --offset N Start N days in the future. The default is to start from
    today.

    --quiet Suppress the progress messages normally written to standard
    error.

    --capabilities Show which capabilities the grabber supports. For more
    information, see

    --version Show the version of the grabber.

    --help Print a help message and exit.
