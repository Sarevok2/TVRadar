DESCRIPTION
    Output TV listings for several channels available in Hungary or Romania.
    The grabber relies on parsing HTML so it might stop working at any time.

    First run tv_grab_huro --configure to choose, which channels you want to
    download. Then running tv_grab_huro with no arguments will output
    listings in XML format to standard output.

    --configure Prompt for which channels, and write the configuration file.

    --config-file FILE Set the name of the configuration file, the default
    is ~/.xmltv/tv_grab_huro.conf. This is the file written by --configure
    and read when grabbing.

    --gui GUITYPE Use this option to enable a graphical interface to be
    used. OPTION may be 'Tk', or left blank for the best available choice.
    Additional allowed values of OPTION are 'Term' for normal terminal
    output (default) and 'TermNoProgressBar' to disable the use of
    Term::ProgressBar.

    --output FILE Write to FILE rather than standard output.

    --days N Grab N days. The default is eight.

    --offset N Start N days in the future. The default is to start from
    today.

    --quiet Suppress the progress messages normally written to standard
    error.

    --slow Enables long strategy run: port.hu publishes only some (vital)
    information on the actual listing pages, the rest is shown in a separate
    popup window. If you'd like to parse the data from these popups as well,
    supply this flag. But consider that the grab process takes much longer
    when doing so, since many more web pages have to be retrieved.

    --get-full-description This is quite like --slow but doesn't always
    download data from popup window. Instead this is only requested if
    description in overview is truncated.

    --list-channels Write output giving <channel> elements for every channel
    available (ignoring the config file), but no programmes.

    --capabilities Show which capabilities the grabber supports. For more
    information, see
    <http://membled.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/XmltvCapabilities>

    --version Show the version of the grabber.

    --icons and --local-icons DIRECTORY get the URL for channel-logos
    together with the channel-list. With --icons specified the logos(images)
    will be not fetched just their URL (http://...) will be written in the
    output XML. If called with --local-icons, the generated URL (file://...)
    will point to the the local directory DIRECTORY and all channel logos
    will be grabbed and saved under this place. Use --no-fetch-icons option
    to disable the icon fetching. Note: icon fetching currently works for
    Hungary and Romania only.

    --max-desc-length LENGTH can be used to maximize the lenght of the
    grabbed program long description. This can be usefull if you have a
    viewer program (using this xmltv output), which can not be display
    userfriendly the description if it is more then LENGTH character.

    --help Print a help message and exit.

BUGS
    The data source does not include full channels information and the
    channels are identified by short names rather than the RFC2838 form
    recommended by the XMLTV DTD.
