NAME
    tv_sort - Sort XMLTV listings files by date, and add stop times.

SYNOPSIS
    tv_sort [--help] [--by-channel] [--output FILE] [FILE...]

DESCRIPTION
    Read XMLTV data and write out the same data sorted in date order. Where
    stop times of programmes are missing, guess them from the start time of
    the next programme on the same channel. For the last programme of a
    channel, no stop time can be added.

    Tv_sort also performs some sanity checks such as making sure no two
    programmes on the same channel overlap.

    --output FILE write to FILE rather than standard output

    --by-channel sort first by channel id, then by date within each channel.

    --duplicate-error If the input contains the same programme more than
    once, consider this as an error. Default is to silently ignore duplicate
    entries.

    The time sorting is by start time, then by stop time. Without
    --by-channel, if start times and stop times are equal then two
    programmes are sorted by internal channel id. With --by-channel, channel
    id is compared first and then times.

    You can think of tv_sort as converting XMLTV data into a canonical form,
    useful for diffing two files.

EXAMPLES
    At a typical Unix shell or Windows command prompt:

    tv_sort <in.xml >out.xml
    tv_sort in.xml --output out.xml

    These are different ways of saying the same thing.
