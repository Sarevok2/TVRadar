DESCRIPTION
    Output TV listings in XMLTV format for many channels available in the
    United Kingdom and Republic of Ireland. Source data comes from
    machine-readable files made available from the Radio Times website.

USAGE
    First run tv_grab_uk_rt --configure to choose which channels you want to
    receive listings for. Then run tv_grab_uk_rt with no arguments to get
    around 14 days of listings for your configured channels.

OPTIONS
    --help Print a help message and exit.

    --version Show the versions of the XMLTV core libraries and the grabber.

    --capabilities Show which capabilities the grabber supports. For more
    information, see <http://xmltv.org/wiki/xmltvcapabilities.html>

    --description Show a brief description of the grabber.

    --config-file FILE Specify the name of the configuration file to use. If
    not specified, a default of ~/.xmltv/tv_grab_uk_rt.conf if used. This is
    the file written by --configure and read when grabbing.

    --output FILE When grabbing, write output to FILE rather than to
    standard output.

    --days N When grabbing, grab N days of data instead of all available.
    Supported values are 1-15.

    --offset N Start grabbing at today + N days. Supported values are 0-14.

    Note that due to the format of the source data, tv_grab_uk_rt always
    downloads data for all days and then filters for days specified with
    --days and --offset. Specifying --days and/or --offset in order to speed
    up downloads or reduce data transfer will therefore not work.

    --quiet Suppress all progress messages normally written to standard
    error.

    --debug Provide detailed progress messages to standard error. Due to the
    volume of debug information produced, it is not advised to use this
    option during normal grabber use.

    --gui OPTION Use this option to enable a graphical interface to be used.
    OPTION may be 'Tk', or left blank for the best available choice.
    Additional allowed values of OPTION are 'Term' for normal terminal
    output (default) and 'TermNoProgressBar' to disable the use of
    Term::ProgressBar.

    --configure Prompt for which channels to download listings for, where to
    store the cache directory for retrieved listings, what character
    encoding to use for output, and also regional and TV platform
    information.

    --list-channels Outputs a list of every channel available to the grabber
    in XMLTV format.

SOURCE DATA
    All data is the copyright of the Radio Times and the use of this data is
    restricted to personal use only. <http://www.radiotimes.com/>

CHARACTER ENCODING
    During configuration, the software asks the user to choose the character
    encoding to be used for output. Current supported encodings are UTF-8
    and ISO-8859-1.

TITLE PROCESSING
    Over time, the listings may contain inconsistent programme details, such
    as the programme title combined with the episode title for some showings
    of a programme, but separate for others; or the episode title being
    given as the programme title, and the programme title given as the
    episode title. Some programme titles may also change slightly over time,
    or between channels. Enabling title processing during configuration
    enables this software to process programme titles against an updated
    list of flagged titles. The software will correct such programme titles,
    which in turn should result in better performance of PVR software which
    rely on consistent programme naming in the XMLTV data. Please be aware
    that enabling title processing will result in the grabber taking longer
    to complete its operation due to the extra processing overhead.

REGIONAL CHANNELS
    During configuration, the software asks for UK postcode information. The
    first half of a user's postcode is used to determine which regional
    channels are available in their locality, and only these matching
    regional channels are included in the list of available channels. A user
    can enter 'none' during configuration to disable regional channel
    filtering. Users in the Republic of Ireland should use the
    pseudo-postcode 'EIRE' to enable filtering of regional channels.

TV PLATFORMS
    After specifying a postcode, the software will ask the user to select
    their TV service platform (Freeview, analogue, Sky, etc) from a list.
    Selecting one of these entries will filter the channel selection list
    (shown at the end of the configuration phase) to show only those
    channels available on the chosen platform. If the user has entered a
    valid postcode, the channel list will also only include those regional
    channels available in the user's locality.

ERROR HANDLING
    tv_grab_uk_rt will only terminate early if it is impossible to continue
    with grabbing data. This can be due to a lack of channel configuration
    data, a bad/missing configuration file, or filesystem permission
    problems. Running the grabber in non-quiet mode should report why the
    grabber failed.

    There have been several occasions when the Radio Times channel index has
    been missing from the Radio Times website. This file is essential to
    being able to run the grabber, as it contains the list of channels
    having available listings data. If this file is missing or empty, and
    there is no locally-cached copy of the file, it will not be possible to
    run the grabber. The file usually regenerates automatically over the
    course of the next day, at which point it will be possible to run the
    grabber.

    Non-fatal errors are reported during a grabber run, and can result in
    listings for a channel being skipped either in part, or entirely.
    Progress messages will state why data is missing when it is possible to
    do so. A non-zero exit status will normally be given when the grabber
    has encountered problems during listings retrieval.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
    The environment variable HOME can be set to change where the
    configuration file is stored. All configuration is stored in
    $HOME/.xmltv/ by default. On Windows it might be necessary to set HOME
    to a pathname containing no spaces.

    The environment variable XMLTV_SUPPLEMENT can be set to change where the
    supplemental XMLTV files are retrieved from. By default, the file is
    retrieved from the XMLTV supplement server. See XMLTV::Supplement for
    more information.

    If you want the grabber to use customised local copies of the
    supplemental files, you should set XMLTV_SUPPLEMENT to the path of the
    directory containing a tv_grab_uk_rt/ directory containing the
    supplement files. For example, if your local supplement files are stored
    in /usr/local/share/xmltv/tv_grab_uk_rt/ you should 'export
    XMLTV_SUPPLEMENT=/usr/local/share/xmltv/' before running the grabber.

MAILING LIST
    You can subscribe to and read the XMLTV users mailing list by visiting
    <http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/xmltv-users>. This is a
    source of help and advice for new users.

BUGS
    If you encounter a reproducible bug, please report it on the XMLTV bug
    tracker at <http://sourceforge.net/projects/xmltv/>, making sure you
    assign the bug to the tv_grab_uk_rt category.

    There is an ongoing issue with the Radio Times source data containing
    mis-encoded UTF-8 characters, which we currently try to handle on a
    case-by-case basis when observed. The issue has been reported to the
    Radio Times who are investigating the problem.

    The source data on the Radio Times website is regenerated nightly.
    Occasionally the source data may not get recreated leaving the source
    files empty. Users are encouraged to wait at least a day before
    reporting an issue with missing listings, as they normally reappear
    during the next night. If listings continue to be missing from the Radio
    Times website, please report it.
