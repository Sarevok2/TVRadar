NAME
    tv_grab_na_icons - Grab channel icon images or links from zap2it.com

SYNOPSIS
    tv_grab_na_icons [--links] [--share dir]

DESCRIPTIONS
    This script goes to the zap2it web site and downloads icon links or
    images to the share/icons directory.

    It was designed to allow icons to be added by tv_grab_na_dd, but there
    is no reason it can't be used for other purposes.

    To minimize the load on zap2it.com, downloaded icons are recommended.
    Links are available for those applications that need it.

    Also to reduce the load on zap2it.com, this script should be run
    sparingly. There is really no need to run it frequently, new networks or
    icons don't show up that often. To emphasize that point, there is no
    --configure mode, the questions need to be answered each run.

OPTIONS
    --links
        Store imge URLs in *.url files instead of downloading images.

    -share *SHAREDIR*
        Icons are stored in *SHAREDIR*/icons. The share directory is set at
        install time, but there may be times when it needs to be specified.
        (for example: no write access to the default share directory)

        --version Show the version of the grabber.

        --help Print a help message and exit.
