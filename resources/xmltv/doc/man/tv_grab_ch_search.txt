DESCRIPTION
    Output TV listings for several channels available in Switzerland and
    (partly) central Europe. The data comes from tv.search.ch. The grabber
    relies on parsing HTML so it might stop working at any time.

    First run tv_grab_ch_search --configure to choose, which channels you
    want to download. Then running tv_grab_ch_search with no arguments will
    output listings in XML format to standard output.

    --configure Ask for each available channel whether to download and write
    the configuration file.

    --config-file FILE Set the name of the configuration file, the default
    is ~/.xmltv/tv_grab_ch_search.conf. This is the file written by
    --configure and read when grabbing.

    --gui OPTION Use this option to enable a graphical interface to be used.
    OPTION may be 'Tk', or left blank for the best available choice.
    Additional allowed values of OPTION are 'Term' for normal terminal
    output (default) and 'TermNoProgressBar' to disable the use of
    Term::ProgressBar.

    --output FILE Write to FILE rather than standard output.

    --days N Grab N days. The default is fourteen.

    --offset N Start N days in the future. The default is to start from now
    on (= zero).

    --quiet Suppress the progress messages normally written to standard
    error.

    --slow enables long strategy run: tv.search.ch publishes only some
    (vital) information on the actual listing pages, the rest is shown in a
    separate popup window. If you'd like to parse the data from these popups
    as well, supply this flag. But consider that the grab process takes much
    longer when doing so, since many more web pages have to be retrieved.

    --list-channels Write output giving <channel> elements for every channel
    available (ignoring the config file), but no programmes.

    --capabilities Show which capabilities the grabber supports. For more
    information, see

    --version Show the version of the grabber.

    --help print a help message and exit.
