NAME
    tv_grab_it - Grab TV listings for Italy.

SYNOPSIS
    tv_grab_it --help

    tv_grab_it [--config-file FILE] --configure

    tv_grab_it [--config-file FILE] [--output FILE] [--days N] [--offset N]
    [--quiet] [--slow] [--verbose] [--errors-in-xml] [--backend
    SITE1[,SITE2[,SITE3]]] [--cache-slow]

DESCRIPTION
    Output TV listings for several channels available in Italy. The grabber
    relies on parsing HTML so it might stop working at any time. The data
    comes from different backends. This is to minimize blackouts in case of
    site changes but also to extend the number of channels. If the grabber
    can't find the data with the first backend it will try the second one,
    and so on. You can specify your order of preference using the --backend
    option.

    Currently configured backends are (in default order):

    skylife - grabs data from www.skylife.it
    mtvit - grabs data from www.mtv.it
    boingtv - grabs data from www.boingtv.it
    sitcom1 - grabs data from www.sitcom1.it
    raisat - grabs data from www.risat.it
    raiit - grabs data from www.rai.it
    iris - grabs data from www.iris.it
    mediasetpremium - grabs data from www.mediasetpremium.it
    First run tv_grab_it --configure to choose which channels you want to
    download. Then running tv_grab_it with no arguments will output listings
    in XML format to standard output.

    --configure Prompt for which channels, and writes the configuration
    file.

    --config-file FILE Set the name of the configuration file, the default
    is ~/.xmltv/tv_grab_it.conf. This is the file written by --configure and
    read when grabbing.

    --gui OPTION Use this option to enable a graphical interface to be used.
    OPTION may be 'Tk', or left blank for the best available choice.
    Additional allowed values of OPTION are 'Term' for normal terminal
    output (default) and 'TermNoProgressBar' to disable the use of
    XMLTV::ProgressBar.

    --output FILE write to FILE rather than standard output.

    --days N Grab N days. The default is 7.

    --offset N Start N days in the future. The default is to start from
    today.

    --quiet Suppress the progress messages normally written to standard
    error.

    --slow Downloads more details (descriptions, actors...). This means
    downloading a new file for each programme, so it's off by default to
    save time.

    --cache-slow If you use the --cache option to speed up thing when you
    grab data several times a week, using this option you will cache only
    the --slow data, so you shouldn't miss changes in schedules.

    --verbose Prints out verbose information useful for debugging.

    --errors-in-xml Outputs warnings as programmes in the xml file, so that
    you can see errors in your favorite frontend in addition to the default
    STDERR.

    --backend Set the backend (or backends) to use. See the examples.

    --version Show the version of the grabber.

    --help Print a help message and exit.

CAVEATS
    If you use --quiet you should also use --errors-in-xml or you won't be
    warned about errors. Note also that, as opposed to previous versions,
    this grabber doesn't die if it cannot find any data, but returns an
    empty (or optionally containing just warnings) xml file instead.

    The backends' data quality differs a lot. For example, mytv was very
    basic, yet complete and uses the least amount of bandwith. Skytv has a
    lot of channels, but unless you use it with the --slow option the data
    is not very good (and in this case i would be VERY slow). wfactory is a
    good overall site if you don't need the whole sky package.

EXAMPLES
    tv_grab_it --backend mtvit --configure
        configures tv_grab_it using only the backend mtvit

    tv_grab_it --backend skylife,wfactory --days 1
        grabs one day of data overiding the default order (could also be
        --backend skylife --backend wfactory)

    tv_grab_it --cache --slow --days 3
        grabs the full data for the next three days using the default
        backend order and using a disk cache.

RECOMMENDED USAGE
    tv_grab_it --cache --slow --cache-slow --errors-in-xml
