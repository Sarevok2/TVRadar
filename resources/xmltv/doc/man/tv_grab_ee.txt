DESCRIPTION
    Output TV listings in XMLTV format for many stations available in
    Estonia. The data comes from www.kava.ee.

    First you must run tv_grab_ee --configure to choose which stations you
    want to receive.

    Then running tv_grab_ee with no arguments will get a listings in XML
    format for the stations you chose for available days including today.

OPTIONS
    --configure Prompt for which stations to download and write the
    configuration file.

    --config-file FILE Set the name of the configuration file, the default
    is ~/.xmltv/tv_grab_ee.conf. This is the file written by --configure and
    read when grabbing.

    --gui OPTION Use this option to enable a graphical interface to be used.
    OPTION may be 'Tk', or left blank for the best available choice.
    Additional allowed values of OPTION are 'Term' for normal terminal
    output (default) and 'TermNoProgressBar' to disable the use of
    XMLTV::ProgressBar.

    --output FILE When grabbing, write output to FILE rather than standard
    output.

    --days N When grabbing, grab N days rather than all available days.

    --offset N Start grabbing at today + N days. N may be negative.

    --quiet Suppress the progress-bar normally shown on standard error.

    --debug Provide more information on progress to stderr to help in
    debugging.

    --list-channels Write output giving <channel> elements for every channel
    available (ignoring the config file), but no programmes.

    --capabilities Show which capabilities the grabber supports. For more
    information, see
    <http://membled.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/XmltvCapabilities>

    --version Show the version of the grabber.

    --help Print a help message and exit.

ERROR HANDLING
    If the grabber fails to download data for some channel on a specific
    day, it will print an errormessage to STDERR and then continue with the
    other channels and days. The grabber will exit with a status code of 1
    to indicate that the data is incomplete.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
    The environment variable HOME can be set to change where configuration
    files are stored. All configuration is stored in $HOME/.xmltv/. On
    Windows, it might be necessary to set HOME to a path without spaces in
    it.

SUPPORTED CHANNELS
    For information on supported channels, see http://www.kava.ee/
