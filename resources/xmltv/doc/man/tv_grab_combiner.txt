NAME
    tv_grab_combiner - Grab listings by combining data from several
    grabbers.

SYNOPSIS
    tv_grab_combiner --help

    tv_grab_combiner --configure [--config-file FILE]

    tv_grab_combiner [--config-file FILE] [--days N] [--offset N] [--output
    FILE] [--quiet]

DESCRIPTION
    Output TV and listings in XMLTV format by combining data from several
    other grabbers.

    First you must run tv_grab_combiner --configure to choose which grabbers
    you want to grab data with and how these grabbers should be configured.

    Then you can run tv_grab_combiner with the --days and --offset options
    to grab data. Omitting these options will use the default values for
    these parameters for each grabber. Since these defaults differs between
    grabbers, you might end up with data for different periods of time for
    different channels.

OPTIONS
    --configure Prompt for which grabbers to use, how these grabbers shall
    be configured and write the configuration file.

    --config-file FILE Set the name of the configuration file, the default
    is ~/.xmltv/tv_grab_combiner.conf. This is the file written by
    --configure and read when grabbing.

    --output FILE When grabbing, write output to FILE rather than standard
    output.

    --days N When grabbing, grab N days rather than 5.

    --offset N Start grabbing at today + N days. N may be negative.

    --quiet Suppress the progress-bar normally shown on standard error.

    --version Show the version of the grabber.

    --help Print a help message and exit.

ERROR HANDLING
    If any of the called grabbers exit with an error, tv_grab_combiner will
    exit with a status code of 1 to indicate that the data is incomplete. If
    any grabber produces output that is not well-formed xml, the output from
    that grabber will be ignored and tv_grab_combiner will exit with a
    status code of 1.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
    The environment variable HOME can be set to change where configuration
    files are stored. All configuration is stored in $HOME/.xmltv/.
