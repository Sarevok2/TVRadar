NAME
    tv_validate_grabber - Validate that an xmltv grabber works correctly

SYNOPSIS
    tv_validate_grabber --help

    tv_validate_grabber [--config-file <configfile>] [--keep-files] <cmd>

DESCRIPTION
    tv_validate_grabber runs a grabber through a series of test to determine
    if it follows the recommendations described at
    <http://membled.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/XmltvCapabilities>

    tv_validate_grabber does not assume that the grabber is written in perl.
    The command does not have to be a single executable, it can also be a
    complete command-line:

    tv_validate_grabber "perl -I lib grab/new/tv_grab_new"

OPTIONS
    --config-file <configfile> Use the specified file as configuration file
    for the grabber. If the file does not exist, the grabber is run with
    --configure to create it. Default is to always run the grabber with
    --configure first and store the configuration in a temporary file.

    --keep-files Do not delete the output-files generated during the
    validation.
