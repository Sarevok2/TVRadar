NAME
    tv_remove_some_overlapping - Remove some overlapping programmes from
    XMLTV data.

SYNOPSIS
    tv_remove_some_overlapping [--help] [--output FILE] [FILE...]

DESCRIPTION
    Read one or more XMLTV files and write a file to standard ouput
    containing the same data, except that some 'magazine' programmes which
    seem to contain two or more other programmes are removed.

    For example, if 'Schools TV' runs from 10:00 to 12:00, and there are two
    programmes 'History' from 10:00 to 11:00 and 'Geography' from 11:00 to
    12:00 on the same channel, then 'Schools TV' could be removed. A
    programme is removed only if there are two or more other programmes
    which partition its timeslot, which implies that it and these other
    programmes must have stop times specified.

    To avoid throwing away any real programmes, no programme will be
    discarded if it has content data other than title and URL.

    Filtering this tool won't remove all overlapping programmes but it will
    deal with the 'big magazine programme containing smaller programmes'
    data commonly seen from listings sources.

    --output FILE write to FILE rather than standard output
