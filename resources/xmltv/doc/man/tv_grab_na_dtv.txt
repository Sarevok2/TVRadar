DESCRIPTION
    Output TV and listings in XMLTV format from directv.com.

    First you must run tv_grab_na_dtv --configure to choose which stations
    you want to receive.

    Then running tv_grab_na_dtv with no arguments will get listings for the
    stations you chose for five days including today.

OPTIONS
    --configure Prompt for which stations to download and write the
    configuration file.

    --config-file FILE Set the name of the configuration file, the default
    is ~/.xmltv/tv_grab_na_dtv.conf. This is the file written by --configure
    and read when grabbing.

    --output FILE When grabbing, write output to FILE rather than standard
    output.

    --days N When grabbing, grab N days rather than 5.

    --offset N Start grabbing at today + N days.

    --quiet Only print error-messages on STDERR.

    --debug Provide more information on progress to stderr to help in
    debugging.

    --list-channels Output a list of all channels that data is available
    for. The list is in xmltv-format.

    --capabilities Show which capabilities the grabber supports.

    --version Show the version of the grabber.

    --help Print a help message and exit.

ERROR HANDLING
    If the grabber fails to download data, it will print an error message to
    STDERR and then exit with a status code of 1 to indicate that the data
    is missing.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
    The environment variable HOME can be set to change where configuration
    files are stored. All configuration is stored in $HOME/.xmltv/. On
    Windows, it might be necessary to set HOME to a path without spaces in
    it.

    TEMP or TMP, if present, will override the directory used to contain
    temporary files. Default is "/tmp", so under Windows one of these is
    required.

BUGS
    DirecTV might want a county ID to show local channels for some zip
    codes. We do not support that. If you encounter this problem, try
    entering a nearby zip code where your local channels appear by default.

    The XML generated for channel information is kludged for compatibility
    with MythTV and is not very pretty.

    Like any screen-scraping grabber, this one will break regularly as the
    web site changes, and you should try to fetch a new one from the
    project's repository. At some point the breakage might not be fixable or
    it may be that nobody wants to fix it. Sane people should use Schedules
    Direct instead.
