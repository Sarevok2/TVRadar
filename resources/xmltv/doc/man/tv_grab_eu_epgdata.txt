DESCRIPTION
    Output TV and listings in XMLTV format for many stations available in
    Europe.

    First you must run tv_grab_eu_epgdata --configure to choose which
    stations you want to receive.

    Then running tv_grab_eu_epgdata with no arguments will get a listings
    for the stations you chose for five days including today.

    This is a commercial grabber. Go to
    http://wiki.xmltv.org/index.php/EU_epgdata to sign up or send an e-mail
    to service@epgdata.com for further information. It's also possible to
    ask for a test account.

OPTIONS
    --configure Prompt for which stations to download and write the
    configuration file.

    --config-file FILE Set the name of the configuration file, the default
    is ~/.xmltv/tv_grab_eu_epgdata.conf. This is the file written by
    --configure and read when grabbing.

    --gui OPTION Use this option to enable a graphical interface to be used.
    OPTION may be 'Tk', or left blank for the best available choice.
    Additional allowed values of OPTION are 'Term' for normal terminal
    output (default) and 'TermNoProgressBar' to disable the use of
    Term::ProgressBar.

    --output FILE When grabbing, write output to FILE rather than standard
    output.

    --days N When grabbing, grab N days rather than 5.

    --offset N Start grabbing at today + N days.

    --quiet Do not show status messages.

    --debug Provide more information on progress to stderr to help in
    debugging.

    --list-channels Output a list of all channels that data is available
    for. The list is in xmltv-format.

    --version Show the version of the grabber.

    --help Print a help message and exit.

    --preferredmethod Shows the preferred method for downloading data (see
    http://xmltv.org/wiki/xmltvcapabilities.html) =head1 ENVIRONMENT
    VARIABLES

    The environment variable HOME can be set to change where configuration
    files are stored. All configuration is stored in $HOME/.xmltv/. On
    Windows, it might be necessary to set HOME to a path without spaces in
    it.

SUPPORTED CHANNELS
    For a list of supported channels, see the channel_ids file distributed
    with this grabber. If additional channels are available, you will
    receive a warning when you run --configure.

    Once I am aware that new channels are available, the channel_ids file
    will be updated and this grabber will automatically fetch an updated
    copy.

COMPATIBILITY
    The channel ids used in this grabber aim to be mostly possible with
    other grabbers, eg tv_grab_de_prisma and some other grabbers for other
    countries. NOTE: Retaining compatibility was not always possible or
    practicable. You can get a list of channel ids using --list-channels

AUTHOR
    Michael Haas, laga -at- laga -dot- ath -dot - cx. This documentation is
    copied from tv_grab_se_swedb by Mattias Holmlund, which in turn was
    copied from tv_grab_uk by Ed Avis. Parts of the code are copied from
    tv_grab_se_swedb and tv_grab_na_dd (in XMLTV 0.5.45) as well as various
    other sources.

BUGS
    There's no proper support for channels with locally different schedules.
    For example, if your EPG package is a German one, you'll get the EPG
    schedule for Germany even if you preferred the Swiss schedule which is
    also available in the data (for some channels at least).

    Timezones are not handled correctly. Currently, you have to enter your
    time zone manually during the configure step. You have to do this every
    time your time zone changes, eg for daylight saving time ("Sommerzeit"
    and "Normalzeit" for my fellow Germans). I'll try to have this fixed for
    the next XMLTV release. Please see this thread for further discussion
    and some additional issues:
    http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.tv.xmltv.devel/7919 FYI: you can
    modify the time zone directly in the config file which is usually
    located at ~/.xmltv/tv_grab_eu_epgdata.conf or ~/.mythtv/FOO.xmltv where
    FOO is the name of your video source in MythTV.

    If the data source gives us data for one day, they'll also cover a part
    of the following day. Maybe this should be fixed. Please note: data is
    not overlapping! So if we want to get data for today, we might as well
    grab yesterday because that'll give us EPG till ~5am for today.

    I'm sure this list is not complete. Let me know if you encounter
    additional problems.
