DESCRIPTION
    Output TV listings for several channels available in France (Hertzian,
    Cable/satellite, Canal+ Sat, TPS). The data comes from
    telepoche.guidetele.com. The default is to grab as many days as possible
    from the current day onwards. By default the program description are not
    downloaded, so if you want description and ratings, you should active
    the --slow option.

    --configure-more-channels Use this option to create AUTRES CHAINES list.
    This allow to grab listings for some channels that are not in
    automatically generated lists. For more informations and a list of
    channels see
    <http://www.lahiette.com/biboobox/forum/viewtopic.php?t=1842>

    --configure Grab channels informations from the website and ask for
    channel type and names.

    --config-file FILE Use FILE as config file instead of the default config
    file. This allow to have different config files for i.e. different apps.

    --gui OPTION Use this option to enable a graphical interface to be used.
    OPTION may be 'Tk', or left blank for the best available choice.
    Additional allowed values of OPTION are 'Term' for normal terminal
    output (default) and 'TermNoProgressBar' to disable the use of
    Term::ProgressBar.

    --output FILE Write to FILE rather than standard output.

    --days N Grab N days starting from today, rather than as many as
    possible. Due to the website organization, the speed is exactly the
    same, whatever the number of days is until you activate the --slow
    option. If --slow is not specified, --days will thus only filter the
    data without speeding up the grabber.

    --offset N Start grabbing N days from today, rather than starting today.
    N may be negative. Due to the website organization, N cannot be inferior
    to -1. As with --days, this is only useful for limiting downloads in
    --slow mode.

    --slow Get additional information from the website, like program
    description, reviews and credits.

    --quiet Suppress the progress messages normally written to standard
    error.

    --noautocorrect Disable the new time overlapping autocorrection
    mechanism.

    --perdays Actually do nothing since "per days" is already set as default
    grabbing mode. This option is kept in the event of "per weeks" set back
    as default. In this case, it could be use to activate the "per days"
    grabbing mode.

    --perweeks Activate the old "per weeks" grabbing mode. It is a fallback
    to use if the grabber does not return any data in the XML file.

    --capabilities Show which capabilities the grabber supports. For more
    information, see <http://xmltv.org/wiki/xmltvcapabilities.html>

    --version Show the version of the grabber.

    --help Print a help message and exit.
