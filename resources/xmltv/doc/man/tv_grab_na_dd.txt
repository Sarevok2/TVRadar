DESCRIPTION
    This script downloads TV listings using Schedules Direct's data service,
    converts it to XMLTV format, and outputs the results.

    You must first register with Schedules Direct at:
    <http://www.schedulesdirect.org>

    Schedules Direct is a non-profit organization whose mission is to
    provide low-cost television program guide data to end-users of Open
    Source and Freeware applications.

    The raw data source is Tribune Media Service's Data Direct Service,
    which is very similar to the free Zap2IT Labs service Tribune previously
    offerred.

    While the service is not available for free, Schedules Direct strives to
    keep costs as low as possible.

    First you must become a member at the <http://www.schedulesdirect.org>
    site.

    Next, you use that website to add lineup(s) to your account.

    Next, you execute "tv_grab_na_dd --configure" to set up the grabber.

    Finally, you execute tv_grab_na_dd with no arguments and it will output
    listings in XML format to standard output. See below for other options.

Stand-alone options
    --help
        Print a help message and exit.

    --version
        Show the version of the grabber.

    --capabilities
        Show which capabilities the grabber supports. For more information,
        see <http://xmltv.org/wiki/xmltvcapabilities.html>

Mode selection (default is grab mode)
    --configure
        Activates configure mode. If a config file already exists the values
        are used as defaults.

    --gui OPTION
        Use this option to enable a graphical interface to be used. OPTION
        may be 'Tk', or left blank for the best available choice. Additional
        allowed values of OPTION are 'Term' for normal terminal output
        (default) and 'TermNoProgressBar' to disable the use of
        Term::ProgressBar.

    --list-lineups
        Lists available lineups. Only requires username in the config file.
        Used by programs that automate the "--configure" process.

General Options
    --config-file *file*
        Set the name of the configuration file, the default is
        ~/.xmltv/tv_grab_na_dd.conf. This is the file created during
        "--configure" mode.

    --dd-data *file*
        Store raw Data Direct data to this file. (default is a temporary
        file)

    --reprocess
        Don't get data from Data Direct, but reprocess a file saved with
        --dd-data.

    --auto-config *add|ignore*
        When used in --configure mode, updates the config file, removing old
        channels, and adding or ignoring new channels. Prompts are skipped
        if defaults are available in the current config file.

        When used in grab mode, appends new channels to the config file.

Grabber Mode options
    --days *n*
        Grab *n* days. The default is 7.

    --offset *n*
        Start N days after the default.

    --quiet
        Suppress some messages normally written to standard error.

    --notrim
        Data Direct includes shows in progress at the start time. The
        default behavior is to filter these shows out so data can be cleanly
        split between days. This option turns off that filter so you get
        shows in progress a tthe start time.

    --old-chan-id
        Use a channel id similar to the one used by the old tv_grab_na
        grabber.

    --low-mem
        Omit all but the most basic program information. Reduces memory
        usage.

    --output *file*
        Write xml to *file* rather than standard output.

    --list-channel
        Same as --days 0

    --share *SHAREDIR*
        tv_grab_na_icons stores icons in *SHAREDIR*/icons. The share
        directory is set at install time, but there may be times when it
        needs to be specified. (for example: no write access to the default
        share directory)

    --list-times
        Report to STDERR the Schedules Direct blockedTime (not currently
        enforced) and suggestedTime values to assist automated processes
        with scheduling.

    --download-only
        Don't generate any output, just fetch the data. Personally I don't
        see the point, but it was requested and easy to add.

    --padd *n*
        Add <n> spaces to the front of the start date. This is normally not
        needed, but can be helpful in working around a Tribune problem when
        the request packet spans TCP packets. Recommended initial value is
        "20". This is only needed if you get "invalid start time" messages.
        If this helps, please post results to the list.

    --dropbadchar
        DD data is supposed to be in UTF-8 format. Sometimes DD sends bad
        characters which cause a "Bad XML from DD" error. This option causes
        those bad characters to be deleted.

    --agent NAME
        appends NAME to the http agent string when fetching data. This is a
        polite way to tell Schedules Direct which application is being used.
        It helps developers know how many people are using their application
        and gives applications credit towards free accounts.

Automating configuration
    Sometimes applications want to call tv_grab_na_dd as a standalone
    application, but automate the configure process. The best way is to hook
    in to the XMLTV::Ask module, but if that's not available, here is a
    solution.

        Step1. Application creates config file with username (and optionally
        password).

        Step2. "tv_grab_na_dd --dd-data lineups.xml --list-lineups"

        Step3. Application adds desired lineup to config file.

        Step4. "tv_grab_na_dd --dd-data lineups.xml --reprocess
        --auto-config add --list-channels"

        Step5. Application edits config file as needed, and deletes
        lineups.xml.

Grabber Timing
    Data Direct offers a "suggested download time" that can be retrieved
    with the "--list-times" option. Its use is encouraged.

Handling Multiple Linups
    tv_grab_na_dd only outputs a single lineup. If your Schedules Direct
    account has multiple lineups, they are all downloaded even though only
    one is output.

    To process multiple lineups, use separate --config-file. Separate config
    files are also handy if you need different channel sets for a lineup
    (common with MythTV). To prevent re-downloading the data on subsequent
    passes, the "--reprocess" option is recommended.

    Here's an example: (the = sign is optional, but helps readability)

     tv_grab_na_dd --config-file=lineup1.dat --output=lineup1.xml --dd-data=dd.xml
     tv_grab_na_dd --config-file=lineup2.dat --output=lineup2.xml --dd-data=dd.xml --reprocess
     tv_grab_na_dd --config-file=lineup3.dat --output=lineup3.xml --dd-data=dd.xml --reprocess

    Each config file specifies the desired lineup and channel list.

    If you want to merge the lineups into a single file, you can use tv_cat

     tv_cat lineup1.xml lineup2.xml lineup3.xml >guide.xml

Non-US/Canada listings. "fake" postal codes.
    TMS's Data direct service proivdes listings for a few non US/Canada
    locations. These are accessed with "fake" postal codes. The following
    are available:

        147BERM Bermuda Cablevision
        366HAMI Hamilton, Bermuda Wow World on Wireless
        101VENE DirecTV Latin America
        904MEXI Mexico #1
        954MEXI Mexico #2
        512TRIN Trinidad Express
        782YOKO Yokota AFB, Japan. Americable International

    For a more complete list, check the Schedules Direct FAQ

Adding icon links to listings
    tv_grab_na_dd checks for channel icons in a directory *share*/icons. The
    *share* directory is usually set during the install. For windows exe
    users, it defaults to the location where xmltv.exe is. tv_grab_na_icons
    is available to download the icons.

Notes on channel lists
    Channel lists can be configured both at the Schedules Direct website and
    through the grabber. This is done to allow multiple config files with
    different channel lists as Schedules Direct only supports a single
    channel map per lineup.

    Similarly, tv_grab_na_dd only supports a single channel mapping for a
    station. If multiple mappings are detected, only the first one is used
    and you are advised to adjust your Schedules Direct lineup.

Notes on episode numbers
    Three episode-num formats are supplied (when available)

    xmltv_ns
        always "..a/b" for part "a" of "b". First two xmltv_ns fields always
        blank.

    dd_progid
        TMS generated "a.b.c/d" where "a" is a unique program id, "b" is a
        unique episode id, "c/d" is part "c" of "d" similar to xmltv_ns.

    onscreen
        Distributor-designated number corresponding to an episode of a
        specific show. Varies by distributor.

Notes on passwords
    If a password is stored in the config file, the config file should be
    properly protected. Instead of storing the password in the config file,
    it can be omitted, and will be prompted for.

Notes on lineup changes
    Data Direct currently adds a channel to your lineup automatically when
    it is available. When tv_grab_na_dd sees the new channel in the
    Schedules Direct lineup, it prints a message (and potentially adds or
    ignores it based on --auto-config).

    If you are sensitive to bandwidth issues, I would set --auto-config
    ignore and periodically check your --config-file for ignored channels
    and remove from your Schedules Direct lineup.

Notes on previously-shown
    Previous releases of tv_grab_na_dd set XMLTV's "date" field for DD
    "original-air-date" field. The correct place for the data is
    "previously-shown->start" The OAD is in both places temporarily for
    compatability reasons.

    DD has dropped the "repeat" flag and replaced it with a "new" flag. Now
    we set "previously-shown

Known issues
    none!
