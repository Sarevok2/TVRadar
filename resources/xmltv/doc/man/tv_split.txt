NAME
    tv_split - Split XMLTV listings into separate files by date and channel.

SYNOPSIS
    tv_split --output TEMPLATE [FILE...]

DESCRIPTION
    Read XMLTV listings and split them into some number of output files. The
    output file chosen for each programme is given by substitutions on the
    filename template supplied. You can split listings by time and by
    channel.

    The TEMPLATE is a filename but substitutions are applied: first %channel
    is replaced with the id of a programme's channel, and then Date::Manip
    substitutions (which broadly follow date(1)) are applied based on the
    start time of each programme. In this way each programme is written to a
    particular output file. When an output file is created it will also
    contain all the channel elements from the input.

    One or more input files can be given; if more than one then they are
    concatenated in the same way as tv_cat. If no input files are given then
    standard input is read.

EXAMPLE
    Use "tv_split --output %channel-%Y%m%d.xml" to separate standard input
    into separate files for each day and channel. The files will be created
    with names like bbc1.bbc.co.uk-20020330.xml.

    Date::Manip(3).
