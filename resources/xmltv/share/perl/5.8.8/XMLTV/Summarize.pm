=head1 NAME

XMLTV::Summarize - Perl extension to summarize XMLTV data

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    # First get some data from the XMLTV module, eg:
    use XMLTV;
    my $data = XMLTV::parsefile('tv_sorted.xml');
    my ($encoding, $credits, $ch, $progs) = @$data;

    # Now turn the sorted programmes into a printable summary.
    use XMLTV::Summarize qw(summarize);
    foreach (summarize($ch, $progs)) {
        if (not ref) {
            print "\nDay: $_\n\n";
        }
        else {
            my ($start, $stop, $title, $sub_title, $channel) = @$_;
            print "programme starts at $start, ";
            print "stops at $stop, " if defined $stop;
            print "has title $title ";
            print "and episode title $sub_title" if defined $sub_title;
            print ", on channel $channel.\n";
        }
    }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module processes programme and channel data from the XMLTV module
to help produce a human-readable summary or TV guide.  It takes care
of choosing the correct language (based on the LANG environment
variable) and of looking up the name of channels from their id.

There is one public routine, C<summarize()>.  This takes (references
to) a channels hash and a programmes list, the same format as those
returned by the XMLTV module.  It returns a list of 'summary' elements
where each element is a list of five items: start time, stop time,
title, 'sub-title', and channel name.  The stop time and sub-title may
be undef.

The times are formatted as hh:mm, with a timezone appended when the
timezone changes in the middle of listings.  For the titles and
channel name, the shortest string that is in an acceptable language is
chosen.

The list of acceptable languages normally contains just one element,
taken from LANG, but you can set it manually as
@XMLTV::Summarize::PREF_LANGS if wished.
