	* grab/uk_rt/tv_grab_uk_rt.in: Splits out variable utf8 fixups into
	  a supplemental file to allow more frequent updating

2009-08-08 20:22  knowledgejunkie

	* MANIFEST, Makefile.PL: Add utf8_fixups to distribution

2009-08-08 18:18  knowledgejunkie

2009-08-07 16:58  knowledgejunkie

	* grab/uk_rt/prog_titles_to_process: Fix up another Monarchy
	  variant

2009-07-30 20:11  knowledgejunkie

	* grab/uk_rt/test.conf: Include Film4 in testing - this is a
	  frequent source of mis-encoded UTF-8 characters

2009-07-30 20:07  knowledgejunkie

	* grab/dk_dr/test.conf: Comment out 2 channels that do not seem to
	  have been providing listings for some time

2009-07-30 19:40  knowledgejunkie

	* grab/uk_rt/tv_grab_uk_rt.in: Ensure output is correctly converted
	  before writing XML, so use Encode::from_to again instead of just
	  Encode::decode. Also ensure that we remove 2-byte UTF-8-encoded
	  non-printing characters instead of their 1-byte ISO-8859-1
	  counterparts, which could themselves be part of multi-byte UTF-8
	  chars. Tidy up some debug messages and perldoc content.

2009-07-30 08:09  knowledgejunkie

2009-07-27 20:15  knowledgejunkie

	* grab/uk_rt/tv_grab_uk_rt.in: A change to the way the grabber
	  handles UTF-8 source data. It now uses Encode::decode to convert
	  the source octets into Perl's internal format, after we have
	  attempted to correct mis-encoded UTF-8 octets we find. This
	  update also adds additional bad char handling and debug ouput for
	  remaining mis-encoded characters, and other small changes to
	  debug output. Finally, we change the default output charset to
	  Unicode (UTF-8) from Latin-1, which seems sensible.

	  the contents of the actor variable with given character's name

2009-06-29 13:03  knowledgejunkie

	* lib/ValidateFile.pm: Update the episode numbering validation
	  regex, allowing additional spacing in the text, and limit the

	  a completely new channel, I have kept it associated with the
	  existing UKTV Documentary XMLTVID so that no changes are required
	  to existing configurations.

2009-02-03 09:17  mnbjhguyt

	  make XML more readable.  Removed outdated comment.

	   - Icon download for romania is also fixed

2008-07-13 22:05  rmeden

2008-07-13 03:01  knowledgejunkie

	* grab/uk_rt/: prog_titles_to_process, tv_grab_uk_rt.in: Adds a
	  title processing routine to enable inconsistent programme titles
	  (such as Law & Order vs Law and Order, please report others) to
	  be updated to a more consistent value. This should allow the
	  grabber to provide more consistent programme titles across
	  channels and over time, and allow better programme matching by
	  PVR software such as MythTV.

2008-07-13 00:23  knowledgejunkie

	* grab/uk_rt/tv_grab_uk_rt.in: Moves episode number detection so
	  that it occurs before title/episode processing. If the only data
	  present in the episode field is the episode number, the episode
	  field will become empty. This should allow title processing to be
	  successful in instances when previously a mixed title/subtitle
	  could not be moved because the episode data contained the episode
	  number details. Also adds some debug output to show when episode
	  numbering has been detected.

2008-07-12 22:33  knowledgejunkie

	* grab/uk_rt/test.conf: Adds encoding and title-processing entries
	  to test configuration

2008-07-12 22:30  knowledgejunkie

	* grab/uk_rt/tv_grab_uk_rt.in: Improvements to episode numbering
	  detection, which should also remove remaining numbering from the
	  title of an episode.

2008-07-12 19:08  rmeden

	* Makefile.PL: remove non-working grabbers in preparation for
	  release: tv_grab_il tv_grab_nl_wolf

2008-07-12 07:25  knowledgejunkie

	* grab/uk_rt/tv_grab_uk_rt.in: Adds comprehensive bad-character
	  handling for the range of lower-case non-Latin characters likely
	  to be seen in listings.

2008-07-12 07:22  knowledgejunkie

	* grab/uk_rt/: channel_ids, channels_platforms: Adds two new
	  channels - Horror Channel +1 and Discovery Knowledge +1

2008-07-12 06:37  knowledgejunkie

	* grab/uk_rt/prog_titles_to_process: Adds a couple more titles

2008-07-08 08:50  ecastelnau

	* grab/re/: test.conf, tv_grab_re:
	  Disable CANALSAT channel because of website/cookies changes not
	  correctly handled for now. If someone has an idea...	PARABOL
	  channel still functionnal.

2008-06-30 09:52  mnbjhguyt

	* grab/uk_rt/channel_ids: Updates BBC channel names to be less loud

2008-06-22 21:09  knowledgejunkie

	* grab/uk_rt/tv_grab_uk_rt.in: Enable additional title-processing
	  via grabber config file instead of using the non-standard runtime
	  command-line option '--no-title-updates'. Title processing is
	  enabled by default. Configuration file entry is
	  'title-processing=enabled' when enabled.

2008-06-22 09:31  knowledgejunkie

	* grab/uk_rt/prog_titles_to_process: More titles to process

2008-06-21 00:06  knowledgejunkie

	* grab/uk_rt/tv_grab_uk_rt.in: Update perldoc to cover new
	  configuration options

2008-06-21 00:00  knowledgejunkie

	* grab/uk_rt/tv_grab_uk_rt.in: Write all programme elements for a
	  channel in one go, rather than one write for each programme. This
	  should help to reduce constant disk activity when running the
	  grabber with a specified output file.

2008-06-20 23:22  knowledgejunkie

	* grab/uk_rt/tv_grab_uk_rt.in: Enables a configuration option for a
	  user to specify which character encoding to use for XMLTV output.
	  With this first update, configuration supports UTF-8 and
	  ISO-8859-1. Let me know of any issues you notice. The source data
	  may still contain invalid UTF-8 encoded characters, and these
	  will still propagate into the output data until we handle them,
	  or the Radio Times fixes the issue.

2008-06-18 06:30  knowledgejunkie

	* Makefile.PL, grab/uk_rt/channels_platforms: Adds a new
	  supplemental file mapping channels to TV platforms for
	  tv_grab_uk_rt.

2008-06-18 06:26  knowledgejunkie

	* grab/uk_rt/tv_grab_uk_rt.in: Enables a configuration option for a
	  user to specify which TV platform they use. This information is
	  then used to filter the list of channels presented during
	  configuration/list-channels to show only those available on their
	  TV platform. Initial TV platforms supported are analogue,
	  Freeview, FreeSat, FreeSat from Sky, Sky Digital, and Virgin TV.
	  Please note that no channel/EPG numbering is provided (yet).

	  filtering of regional channels during configuration. The user is
	  asked for the first past of their postcode, and only those
	  channels determined to be available in their locality are

2008-06-03 01:55  knowledgejunkie

	* grab/uk_rt/tv_grab_uk_rt.in: Makes a cachedir entry a requirement

	  Thanks to XMLTV::Supplement, it is not longer needed to specify
	  the share directory in tv_grab_eu_epgdata. Thsi commit gets rid

	* grab/uk_rt/tv_grab_uk_rt.in: Catches more separators seen in
	  updated listing information.

2008-04-13 01:21  knowledgejunkie

	  placeholder variable for future use.

2008-04-07 19:12  jveldhuis

	* lib/IMDB.pm: version .8     = updated file size est calculations
	  = moviedb.dat directors and actors list no longer include

	  reference extraction

2008-04-02 02:45  knowledgejunkie

	* grab/uk_rt/tv_grab_uk_rt.in: Adds support for another UTF-8
	  character seen after conversion to ISO 8859-1.

2008-04-02 02:30  knowledgejunkie

	* grab/uk_rt/tv_grab_uk_rt.in: Grabber will now return a non-zero

2008-03-28 23:41  knowledgejunkie

	* grab/uk_rt/tv_grab_uk_rt.in: Updates handling of GMT/BST
	  changeover. We now use the given start time and programme length,
	  as detailed testing has revealed inconsistent flagging (and
	  non-flagging) of programmes giving incorrect stop times. This
	  change seems to work well - in recent months I have not seen any
	  problems with the given programme durations beging incorrect.
	  This update should also work for the changeover at the end of
	  BST, but we shall have to wait until October to find out.

2008-03-28 22:08  knowledgejunkie

	* grab/uk_rt/prog_titles_to_process: More titles

2008-03-28 06:52  knowledgejunkie

	* grab/uk_rt/tv_grab_uk_rt.in: Reduces the number of situations in
	  which the grabber will terminate prematurely. We now skip any
	  entries that are malformed or missing but would otherwise allow
	  the grabber to continue, instead of immediately invoking die().
	  Debug output details any config entries/channels/programmes that
	  have been skipped during execution. Only those situations deemed
	  fatal to the grabber (e.g. missing Radio Times or XMLTV
	  supplement file data, or a missing config file) will now result
	  in a premature exit.

2008-03-28 02:53  knowledgejunkie

	* grab/uk_rt/tv_grab_uk_rt.in: Improves checking of prerequisite
	  information necessary for grabbing and improves feedback when
	  problems are detected.

2008-03-27 23:51  knowledgejunkie

	* grab/uk_rt/tv_grab_uk_rt.in: Implement convenience debugging
	  method as used in tv_grab_se_swedb to reduce clutter in code.

2008-03-27 23:00  knowledgejunkie

	* grab/uk_rt/tv_grab_uk_rt.in: Updates GMT/BST handling to use
	  start time and programme duration to determine correct stop time
	  for flagged programmes, as stop times can be incorrectly stated
	  in source data. Another couple of other small code tidy-ups.

2008-03-27 22:40  knowledgejunkie

	* grab/uk_rt/tv_grab_uk_rt.PL: First in a series of major code
	  clean-ups, inspired in part by Perl Best Practices and
	  tv_grab_se_swedb. There should be no functional changes.

2008-03-27 18:54  knowledgejunkie

	* grab/uk_rt/tv_grab_uk_rt.in: First in a series of major code

2008-03-25 16:49  attila_nagy

	* grab/huro/tv_grab_huro.in:  - It has been asked for a stop
	  attribute on the programmes. EyeTV needs it.
	     so here is a quick fix for this.

2008-03-25 12:43  betlit

	* grab/ch_search/tv_grab_ch_search.in: fixed a bug causing grabbing
	  to fail if there is a '=' sign present in the title of a show and
	  --slow is not used.

2008-03-23 13:53  mihaas

	* grab/eu_epgdata/tv_grab_eu_epgdata.in: * get the code for the

	  regular expressions * remove hardcoded channel group code from
	  --configure step * remove some cruft

2008-03-21 10:58  knowledgejunkie

	* grab/uk_rt/channel_ids: Updates descriptions for those few
	  channels (generally non-24hr) available on Freeview having
	  different listings/XMLTV IDs compared to their satellite/cable
	  counterparts which are shown uninterrupted. Should make
	  configuration of these channels unambiguous. Request from Steve
	  Goodey.

2008-03-17 02:09  ngarratt

	* grab/za/test.conf: Switch to DSTV - MNET only providing limited
	  channels for now

2008-03-15 07:15  mnbjhguyt

	* grab/it/: channel_ids: new channels

2008-03-14 05:22  knowledgejunkie

	* grab/uk_rt/tv_grab_uk_rt.in: Removes Log::TraceMessages module
	  code, which is not currently used. Detailed debugging information
	  is currently available using the --debug option.

2008-03-14 05:07  knowledgejunkie

	* grab/uk_rt/prog_titles_to_process: Adds a couple more titles to

	  'F1', where possible.

2008-03-14 04:46  knowledgejunkie

	* grab/uk_rt/tv_grab_uk_rt.in: Adds handling for 2 more badly

2008-02-22 10:18  knowledgejunkie

	* Makefile.PL, grab/uk_rt/tv_grab_uk_rt.in: Converts tv_grab_uk_rt
	  to use Encode rather than Unicode::UTF8simple for UTF-8
	  conversion. Now that Perl 5.6 is no longer supported since the
	  release of 5.10, and Encode is part of Perl 5.8+, it seems
	  sensible to move to a core module. Thanks to Chris Butler for
	  supplying the patch.

2008-02-22 09:12  knowledgejunkie

	* grab/uk_rt/channel_ids: Adds 3 new channels just added by the
	  Radio Times - Discovery Real Time Extra, Movies4Men, and True
	  Movies.

2008-02-18 13:16  rmeden

	  so mixed case comparisions work.

2008-02-17 20:58  rmeden

2008-02-17 02:42  knowledgejunkie

	* grab/uk_rt/tv_grab_uk_rt.in: Removes title processing data from
	  grabber and places it in a new file, prog_titles_to_process,
	  which is retrieved via XMLTV::Supplement. Also adds more useful
	  debugging messages for UTF-8 characters and provides more
	  detailed information on number and types of available channels.

	  2-field (code|title) approach.

2008-02-15 22:45  knowledgejunkie

	* MANIFEST, Makefile.PL: Updates for current development version of
	  tv_grab_uk_rt. Removes unnecessary prereq for HTML::Entities and

2008-02-09 20:15  knowledgejunkie

	* grab/uk_rt/tv_grab_uk_rt.in: Fixes an oversight which was causing
	  the listings for part-time channels starting and stopping
	  broadcast on the same calendar day (e.g. UKTV History) to contain
	  programme entries during the channel's off-air period.

2008-02-08 03:31  b4max

	* grab/br_net/test.conf: making the testsuite happy with a new

	* grab/eu_epgdata/tv_grab_eu_epgdata.in: Fix --configure by
	  reverting to the old behavior of just concatenating strings
	  instead of using the proper libraries to the job.  It looks like
	  XMLTV::Twig is breaking the redirection to stdout..

2008-01-30 14:48  b4max

	* grab/br_net/tv_grab_br_net: adapted for changes on the grabbed
	  website

2008-01-30 10:18  ecastelnau

2008-01-25 18:40  knowledgejunkie

	* grab/uk_rt/channel_ids: Adds regionalised icons for ITV1 channels

2008-01-23 17:11  knowledgejunkie

	* grab/uk_rt/tv_grab_uk_rt.in: More programme titles to process
	  against

2008-01-22 11:39  knowledgejunkie

	* grab/uk_rt/tv_grab_uk_rt.in: Adds another programme title to
	  process against

2008-01-22 11:16  knowledgejunkie

	* grab/uk_rt/channel_ids: Reorders the channel entries. The file
	  now contains the timeshifted and part-time channel entries first,
	  and lists the regular channels available from the Radio Times
	  afterwards. This should allow the released 0.5.50 (and previous)
	  grabber to continue to use the regular channels during
	  configuration and write usable XMLTV IDs to the config file. When
	  channel_ids is parsed and the rt_to_xmltv hash is created, the
	  timeshifted and part-time entries should be overwritten by the
	  later 'regular' channel entries, which also share the same RT ID.
	  The logic to cater for multiple channels sharing the same RT ID
	  is only available in CVS right now, so this should allow current
	  and future releases of the grabber to share the same channel_ids
	  file.

2008-01-22 10:56  rmeden

	* Makefile.PL: remove tv_grab_no at author's request. Been replaced
	  by tv_grab_no_gfeed

2008-01-21 01:52  knowledgejunkie

	* grab/uk_rt/tv_grab_uk_rt.in: Adds some more programme titles to
	  process against

2008-01-20 04:44  knowledgejunkie

	* grab/uk_rt/tv_grab_uk_rt.in: Adds title processing routine to
	  accommodate programmes having titles in format sub-title:title.
	  Updates other title processing routines to cater for situations
	  where a subtitle is given in title and separately in episode
	  field. Adds a couple of new programme titles to match against
	  during processing. Increases duration that the grabber will read
	  from cache to 1hr now that we re-use the data for timeshifted and
	  part-time channels.

2008-01-18 17:39  knowledgejunkie

	* grab/uk_rt/tv_grab_uk_rt.in: Re-enables timeshifted channel
	  support, which I inadvertently disabled in the last update.

2008-01-18 11:49  knowledgejunkie

	* grab/uk_rt/: channel_ids, tv_grab_uk_rt.in: Adds support for
	  part-time channels seen on platforms such as FreeView, which do
	  not have the resources to broadcast all channels, all the time.
	  This update allows tv_grab_uk_rt to create time-restricted
	  listings for channels such as UKTV History and Virgin 1, which
	  are only broadcast during certain hours of the day on FreeView.
	  New XMLTV IDs have been created for these new channels. Listings
	  for other part-time channels on Freeview are already available
	  from the Radio Times feed, with Nuts TV and Smile TV being the
	  only FreeView channels currently unsupported by the grabber. As
	  always, please report any issues you encounter.

2008-01-16 21:44  knowledgejunkie

	* grab/uk_rt/tv_grab_uk_rt.in: Adds title/sub-title processing,
	  which should begin to produce more consistent programming
	  information over time. Some programme titles are supplied
	  containing the programme's sub-title, but future listings may
	  contain the correct title and a separate sub-title. To ease this
	  inconsistency we parse out the sub-title information where we
	  have prior knowledge of the title. Update also adds more flagged
	  non-title information to remove from titles. All title processing
	  can be disabled by using the --no-title-updates option.

2008-01-16 14:16  knowledgejunkie

	* grab/uk_rt/tv_grab_uk_rt.in: Adds a '--no-title-updates' option
	  to the grabber to disable processing of programme titles. In
	  order to achieve consistency between channels and repeat showings
	  of programmes, the grabber can remove certain pieces of non-title
	  information from a programme's title. Such information may
	  include 'season' information ('Bond Season' etc) or
	  programme-genre/channel information ('CBBC:'). Before I add more
	  processing to enable the grabber to better split compounded
	  title-subtitle programme titles into their constituent element to
	  boost progamme matching, I am adding this override so that any
	  users who wish to receive unadulterated programme titles can
	  contine to do so.

2008-01-16 13:41  knowledgejunkie

	* grab/uk_rt/channel_ids: Updates display name for UKTV Gardens.
	  Note that the previous commit (Timeshifted channels support) also
	  updated a few channel names.

2008-01-16 13:08  knowledgejunkie

	* grab/uk_rt/: channel_ids, tv_grab_uk_rt.in: Adds timeshifted
	  channel support to tv_grab_uk_rt. This enables the creation of
	  (arbitrarily) timeshifted listings based on any listings
	  available from the Radio Times. I have tried to ensure that all
	  currently available +1/+2 channels are supported for new
	  installations, which means that several previously-unsupported
	  channels have listings available (use tv_grab_uk_rt
	  --list-channels for the full list). No changes have been made to
	  the availability of the Radio Times supplied +1/+2 listings, so
	  these should continue to work as before. Existing users wishing
	  to switch from the Radio Times supplied timeshifted listings to
	  the new native tv_grab_uk_rt timeshifted listings need only to
	  update the XMLTV IDs for these channels in their XMLTV config
	  file and related software (i.e. MythTV). New timeshifted listings
	  have tsod. (TimeShifted Original Data) prepended to the existing
	  RT-supplied timeshifted channel's XMLTV ID - check the
	  channel_ids file for more information. I have also tried to
	  ensure that GMT/BST timings remain correct after this update.
	  Many thanks to David Greaves for the initial patch upon which I
	  have based this update.

	  titles that may include non-title information

2008-01-07 05:25  knowledgejunkie

	* grab/uk_rt/tv_grab_uk_rt.in: Reverts handling of a bad UTF-8
	  Degree symbol character coded as <C3><8B><C2><9A> in the source
	  data. The decoded character should be the Latin-1 Degree symbol
	  <B0>, but instead is the Latin-1 (not UTF-8) E-umlaut character
	  <CB>

2008-01-07 03:43  knowledgejunkie

	* grab/uk_rt/tv_grab_uk_rt.in: Adds handling of a bad UTF-8
	  characters which remains undecoded in Latin-1 output (Degree
	  symbol, Channel 4 listings)

2008-01-07 03:24  knowledgejunkie

	* grab/uk_rt/tv_grab_uk_rt.in: Adds a --debug option to the
	  grabber, which provides detailed progress information on
	  configuration, file downloads, listings processing, and output
	  generation during a grabber run. It is recommended to run the
	  grabber without progress bars for the clearest output. This
	  update also cleans up the standard non-debug log output.

2008-01-05 19:09  knowledgejunkie

	* grab/uk_rt/tv_grab_uk_rt.in: Adds basic handling of some invalid
	  UTF-8 characters which remain undecoded in Latin-1 output

	* grab/na_dtv/tv_grab_na_dtv: fixed failure to pick up the first

	  time slot

2008-01-03 23:39  knowledgejunkie

	* grab/uk_rt/tv_grab_uk_rt.in: Since the resumption of the Radio
	  Times' XMLTV service in early January 2008, the RT source data
	  appears to be in valid UTF-8 format, with only minor
	  bad-character issues noted to date. We therefore use the
	  Unicode::UTF8simple module to convert the UTF-8 format source
	  data into ISO 8859-1 Latin 1 text for processing and output. As a
	  result of this change, please report any occurences of odd
	  characters in the output data.

2008-01-02 19:59  knowledgejunkie

	* grab/uk_rt/tv_grab_uk_rt.in: Tidies up non-fatal line breaks in

2008-01-02 19:14  knowledgejunkie

	* grab/uk_rt/tv_grab_uk_rt.in: Adds yet more handling for
	  non-English characters in listings data. These now seem to be all
	  prefixed with 0xC3 instead of a mixture of 0xC3 and 0xC8 in the
	  source data, but in a more consistent manner. I am hopeful the
	  source data can be corrected to remove these odd 2-byte
	  characters and replace them with their correct ISO/IEC 8859-1
	  codes

	  HTTP::Cache::Transparent available from the author's git

2007-12-11 01:22  knowledgejunkie

	* grab/uk_rt/tv_grab_uk_rt.in: Adds more bad character handling.

	  DOCTYPE element in Radio Times data which indicates a lack of
	  usable data. Users wanting to take advantage of tv_grab_uk_rt's
	  bad/missing data support will need to upgrade
	  HTTP::Cache::Transparent to a release later than 0.7

2007-12-07 03:28  knowledgejunkie

	* grab/uk_rt/tv_grab_uk_rt.in: Additional bad character handling.

2007-12-07 03:17  knowledgejunkie

	* grab/uk_rt/tv_grab_uk_rt.in: Implements support for the
	  approveContent callback functionality being added to
	  HTTP::Cache::Transparent. This will allow the grabber to
	  successfully retrieve new listings even during those periods when
	  the Radio Times' index file (channels.dat) is empty. This
	  scenario currently causes the grabber to fail as it cannot
	  determine the available channels. With the new support in
	  H::C::T, a previously cached copy of channels.dat (if available)
	  will instead be used and will only be updated if the online
	  version is updated with actual content.

2007-11-30 17:54  knowledgejunkie

	* grab/uk_rt/tv_grab_uk_rt.in: Ensures cached data files are kept
	  for no more than 15 days. The Radio Times data contains listings
	  information for at most 2 weeks, so this ensures no stale data is
	  retained.

	  lib/Options.pm: Sourceforge patch #1560348: * Added new grabber
	  for Estonian tv stations (and other channels visible	 in
	  Estonia) based on www.kava.ee listings. Old grabber is not
	  working any	more.  * use UTF-8 for STDERR terminal output if
	  UTF-8 encoding configured * when writing channel config keep
	  original encoding * make it possible for external modules to get
	  output file handle   (XML::Writer uses STDIO instead of default
	  output if not specified)

	  trilogie du samedi'.

2005-12-27 03:42  epaepa

	* README: Removed special note about Archive::Zip versions now
	  tv_grab_uk_bleb has a workaround for the bug.  I have
	  Archive::Zip 1.16 and it's still broken, but now we don't care.

2005-12-27 03:40  epaepa

	* grab/se_swedb/tv_grab_se_swedb: Cosmetic change to XML output.

2005-12-26 14:54  epaepa

	* grab/ee/tv_grab_ee: Added a --cache option like the other
	  grabbers.

	  Correct an occasional error (empty <desc>) in the upstream XML.

2005-12-26 10:55  epaepa

	* grab/za/tv_grab_za: Fixed for site changes.  Previously I think
	  the site wrote programme times as images, but now they're just
	  bold text.  (The output was giving every programme time as
	  January 1st 1970.)

	  Added --offset option.  It was included in the usage message but
	  not accepted.  However, because the site doesn't allow grabbing
	  with an offset, the option just extends the range of days
	  grabbed.  So if you ask for 'two days starting tomorrow' you will
	  in fact get the next week, since that's the shortest range
	  including what you requested.  Also reworked the number of days
	  code a little bit in general, so that a --days flag on the
	  command line overrides any config file setting.

	  The grabber has its own simple --cache mechanism but this was
	  never used since XMLTV::Memoize::check_argv() gobbles any --cache
	  flag given on the command line.  And the function memoized wasn't
	  ever called.	I have removed the check_argv() call so now caching
	  does something; however it needs to be revisited because writing
	  known filenames in /tmp/ is a security hole.

	  Added a little more error checking, and try to include the URI in
	  some error messages.

	  New dependency: List::Util.  I'll check on the mailing list about
	  this.

2005-12-26 04:03  epaepa

2004-04-06 00:36  rmeden

2004-04-03 11:39  stesie

	* grab/de_tvtoday/tv_grab_de_tvtoday.in: tvtoday.de homepage
	  actually doesn't allow to view program more than six days ahead,
	  however the grabber allowed to do so (using --force).  Turned off
	  this behaviour, since setting ztag=8 (as http get arg) returns
	  program for yesterday - allow the user to do "--offset -1"
	  instead.

2004-04-03 10:45  epaepa

2004-04-03 04:01  epaepa

	* lib/exe_wrap.pl: Don't use require() to run the executable, since
	  that needs the last statement to give a true value.  Just load
	  the code and eval it.

	  Also fixed exit status of this script so it is true for success.

2004-04-03 03:05  epaepa

	  grab/dk/tv_grab_dk, grab/na_dd/tv_grab_na_dd,
	  grab/nl/tv_grab_nl.in, grab/no/tv_grab_no, lib/XMLTV.pm.in:
	  <episode-num> can now be repeated.  This is a
	  backwards-incompatible change for users of XMLTV.pm (it's now a
	  list reference) and anyone reading xmltv files.  However the new
	  files are a superset of the old ones, so it does not break
	  existing data.

2004-03-31 00:07  rmeden

	* grab/uk_rt/tv_grab_uk_rt.in: Another patch from Niel Markwick:
	  fix the occasional title-parsing bug, and replace one while () {

2004-02-11 13:34  epaepa

	* grab/uk_rt/tv_grab_uk_rt.in: Patch mostly by Neil Markwick to
	  reduce the number of page fetches by remembering the last
	  programme seen on a channel and skipping ahead some hours if
	  possible.  Also to give a --limit-details range for restricting
	  the download of programme details (not all or nothing like

	  multi-paragraph descriptions as one <desc> element.

2004-02-07 11:02  epaepa

2004-01-29 14:05  epaepa

	* t/test_icon.t: Made into a proper test ('ok 1', at least when it

2004-01-24 16:40  epaepa

	* grab/Get_nice.pm: Applied Sourceforge patch #875950 from Niel
	  Markwick: have a delay between page fetches, but remember when
	  the last fetch was and sleep() only for the time necessary to
	  make up the delay.

2004-01-24 15:39  epaepa

	* grab/uk_rt/: channel_ids, tv_grab_uk_rt.in: Applied (with minor
	  tweaks) Sourceforge patch #877617 from Niel Markwick to get extra
	  channels from the site.  It turns out you only need supply a
	  couple of cookies, and the site doesn't care what their values
	  are.

	  Made the grabber fetch summary data by default, with a --slow
	  flag to enable the one-page-per-programme detailed grabbing.

	  Better behaviour if asking questions during configuration fails.

2004-01-20 13:57  epaepa

	* filter/tv_split, t/test_tv_split.t: If tv_split is splitting by
	  channel, then just one <channel> element should be written to
	  each output file.

2004-01-20 13:33  epaepa

	* t/test_tv_split.t: Fixed filename in error messages.

2004-01-20 13:06  epaepa

	* lib/IMDB.pm: closeMaybeGunzip(): even a plain close() segfaults
	  on some systems, so do nothing.

2004-01-12 20:38  jveldhuis

	  fix XMLTV::Date manual page.

2004-01-06 23:56  rmeden

2004-01-06 14:38  epaepa

	* grab/uk/: channel_ids, channel_pkgs/gratis, channel_pkgs/travel,

2004-01-06 13:45  epaepa

	* filter/tv_sort, t/data/tv_sort_overlap_xml.expected_err: Made the
	  error output (overlap warning) repeatable by adding a 'sort' and
	  by removing a $Log::TraceMessages::On that caused warnings.

2004-01-06 13:42  epaepa

	* choose/tv_pick/tv_pick_cgi, lib/Clumps.pm: Commented out lone
	  mentions of $Log::TraceMessages::On which tend to cause warnings.

2004-01-06 13:15  epaepa

	* lib/exe_wrap.pl: Check for the mistake of running a command with
	  redirections from Windows's Run dialogue box instead of the
	  command prompt.

2004-01-06 12:53  epaepa

	* grab/uk_rt/tv_grab_uk_rt.in: Patch from Edward Wildgoose to
	  recognize the site's star ratings.

2004-01-05 14:52  epaepa

	* mkdist, lib/exe_wrap.pl: Support 'xmltv.exe --version'.  (mkdist
	  changes not yet tested.)

2004-01-04 11:04  epaepa

	* lib/XMLTV.pm.in: Moved the __WARN__ handler on writing down a
	  level to call_handlers_write() so that the warning message can
	  include the name of the subelement being written as well as the
	  big element ('programme' or whatever).  call_handlers_write() now
	  returns a success value which is checked before calling it again
	  with the real XML::Writer.

	* Makefile.PL: Discard stderr when trying to run python - it might

2004-01-04 04:48  epaepa

	* lib/XMLTV.pm.in: 'require' rather than 'use' XMLTV::Date because

	  then.  (Sourceforge bug #870171.)

2004-01-04 04:33  epaepa

2004-01-02 13:41  epaepa

	* grab/nl/tv_grab_nl.in: get_channels(): read the channel names
	  file.  The new boolean parameter says whether to read the site as
	  well and reconcile the two (more paranoia, but also more
	  downloading).

	  Call get_channels() to get channel details before grabbing as
	  well as for --configure and --list-channels.	--configure still
	  downloads the channel list from the site but --list-channels and
	  grabbing do not.  Changed the error about bad channel names to a
	  warning, since it can happen if the channels file has different
	  names from the site.

	  grab/nl/tv_grab_nl.PL, grab/nl/tv_grab_nl.in, lib/exe_wrap.pl:
	  Repackaged tv_grab_nl so it follows some of the other grabbers in
	  having a data file in share/ which it needs to load at run time.
	  tv_grab_nl is generated from tv_grab_nl.in by substituting in the
	  configured share/ path.

	  Now this new version doesn't _do_ anything different, and has no
	  code changes apart from setting the share/ directory and the
	  filename of the channels file, but because the source filename
	  has changed I'm committing now so that diffing will be simpler.

2004-01-02 12:34  epaepa

	* grab/nl/tv_grab_nl: Don't rely on channel names in the config
	  file: wait until we've read the listings pages (and so have got
	  channel names) before writing any <channel> elements.  The config
	  file no longer contains channel names, although old format files
	  are still accepted for now.

2004-01-02 12:27  epaepa

	* lib/XMLTV.pm.in: Made the writing handlers accept undef instead
	  of an XML::Writer, and take it as meaning don't write anything.
	  Then write_element_with_handlers() first calls all the handlers
	  with undef and makes sure there are no warnings before it writes
	  anything.  This makes it a bit harder to produce invalid output.

2004-01-02 11:59  epaepa

	* grab/nl/tv_grab_nl: Take note of the channel names on the site
	  and check them against what's in the config file.

2004-01-01 05:39  epaepa

	* grab/es/tv_grab_es: Include the channel number (the number from
	  the site, which is apparently the same as the button number on a
	  television) as an extra display-name.

2004-01-01 05:31  epaepa

	* mkdist, filter/tv_extractinfo_en, filter/tv_grep.in,
	  filter/tv_remove_some_overlapping, filter/tv_sort,
	  grab/Europe_TZ.pm, grab/Grab_XML.pm, grab/dk/tv_grab_dk,
	  grab/es/tv_grab_es, grab/fi/tv_grab_fi, grab/hu/tv_grab_hu,
	  grab/na/tv_grab_na, grab/nl/tv_grab_nl, grab/uk/tv_grab_uk.in,
	  grab/uk_rt/tv_grab_uk_rt.in, lib/Clumps.pm, lib/Date.pm,
	  lib/TZ.pm, lib/XMLTV.pm.in: Changed most ParseDate() calls to
	  parse_date() instead.  Then a manual check of the return value is
	  not needed (though in cases where a bad date is acceptable the
	  parse_date() call must be wrapped in eval {}).  Also changed
	  parse_eur_date() and tz_to_num() to throw exceptions on error.

	  Where ParseDate() is called, the recommended way in the
	  Date::Manip docs to check for errors is to test the truth value
	  of what's returned.

2003-12-31 14:54  epaepa

	* Makefile.PL, grab/Europe_TZ.pm, grab/nl/tv_grab_nl,
	  grab/uk_rt/tv_grab_uk_rt.in, lib/Date.pm: New library XMLTV::Date
	  with a parse_date() wrapper for ParseDate() that makes a more
	  intelligent choice of year.  ParseDate() assumes the current year
	  if it's not given, which obviously causes problems when grabbing
	  listings across a year boundary.  parse_date() picks the closest
	  possibility to the current time.  It also throws an exception on
	  failure rather than returning the empty string.

	  Eventually I hope to replace all ParseDate() calls with this
	  function, but for now I just fixed Europe_TZ.pm (which gets
	  tv_grab_nl working again) and tv_grab_uk_rt.

2003-12-31 14:51  epaepa

	* t/test_filters.t: Set LANG=C for running tests; we can do this
	  with the latest Lingua::Preferred.

2003-12-31 14:50  epaepa

	* lib/AskTerm.pm: When presenting a numbered list of options,
	  accept typing the option string instead of the number.  (And made
	  the prompt shorter.)

2003-12-31 12:28  epaepa

	* Makefile.PL: Lingua::Preferred 0.2.4 now recommended (it accepts
	  LANG=C).

2003-12-31 12:13  epaepa

	* lib/IMDB.pm: Added a missing /i to compare titles
	  case-insensitively; this fixes the bug found by Karen Etheridge
	  where duplicate (modulo case) titles would be added.

2003-12-31 11:59  epaepa

	* grab/na/: ZapListings.pm, tv_grab_na: Parsing the Sourceforge
	  project page to get version number had stopped working, so
	  changed to use the Freshmeat XML project record instead.

2003-12-31 11:45  epaepa

	* grab/na/tv_grab_na: Accept the --cache option in configuration
	  mode too and pass it as CacheDir to ZapListings.pm.  Now it's
	  just up to ZapListings to use it...

2003-12-30 14:51  epaepa

	* grab/fi/tv_grab_fi: Recognize class 'kanava-klo-nyt' (used for
	  current programme) as well as 'kanava-klo'.  Pointed out by Riku
	  Voipo.

2003-12-30 14:15  epaepa

	* MANIFEST, grab/uk/channel_pkgs/NTL/analogue_ie: tv_grab_uk
	  channel package for NTL analogue cable TV in the Republic of
	  Ireland.

2003-12-29 14:21  epaepa

	* MANIFEST, grab/uk/channel_ids, grab/uk/channel_pkgs/adult,
	  grab/uk/channel_pkgs/ireland, grab/uk/channel_pkgs/scotland:
	  Fixed some errors and warnings in tv_grab_uk's channel ids; the
	  'scotland' package has disappeared since it contained only one
	  channel and that is no longer on the site.

	  Implemented Sourceforge feature request #858792 by adding more
	  channels to the 'ireland' package.  I've also set xmltv ids for
	  those Irish channels that lacked them.

2003-12-29 14:14  epaepa

	* grab/uk/tv_grab_uk.in: Earlier and more informative check of the
	  same Ananova channel mapped to two xmltv ids in the channel_ids
	  file.

2003-12-18 23:09  rmeden

	* Makefile.PL: correct min version for HTML::Parser (got confused
	  with XML::Parser)

2003-12-18 23:01  rmeden

	* filter/tv_imdb: expand on memory requirments in man page

2003-12-18 13:48  epaepa

	* lib/AskTerm.pm: match(): new routine factoring out selecting an
	  exact or substring match.

2003-12-18 13:44  epaepa

	* lib/AskTerm.pm: askQuestion(): if going to numbered prompting,
	  and any of the options happen to themselves be numbers in the
	  range, make sure they are at that question number.  Too confusing
	  to type '5' to enter option '6'.  The list of options is now
	  required to have no duplicates.

2003-12-14 13:52  epaepa

	* filter/tv_sort, t/data/tv_sort_overlap_xml.expected_err: Changed
	  tv_sort to complain less about overlapping programmes.  In
	  particular if two programmes start at the same time and one of
	  them is zero length, assume it just squeezes in before the other.
	  As a side effect, fixed some other minor bugs in reporting of
	  overlaps (I hope that tv_sort will now not report an overlap
	  unless it's certain there is one).  But this whole exercise has
	  proven I don't really understand the intended meaning of
	  zero-length programmes and intervals (many listings sources
	  generate zero-length programmes, and they seem to be of some
	  vague practical use, but I haven't really thought out the
	  implications).  Hopefully the new DTD (with explicit timeslots
	  replacing clumpidxes) will be a bit saner.

2003-12-14 12:12  epaepa

	* t/data/tv_sort_overlap_xml.expected_err: Catch bug in tv_sort
	  where it incorrectly reports about overlapping programmes because
	  it doesn't treat (start, stop) as a half-closed interval.

2003-12-14 12:09  epaepa

	* t/test_filters.t: Include tv_to_text, and running commands on
	  just overlap.xml, in the standard set of tests.

2003-12-14 12:08  epaepa

	* t/data/: overlap.xml, tv_cat_all_UTF8.expected,

	  input file.

	  t/data/tv_remove_some_overlapping_sort2_xml.expected,
	  t/data/tv_remove_some_overlapping_sort_xml.expected:
	  tv_remove_some_overlapping: write output programmes in same order
	  as input, rather than writing uninteresting programmes as early
	  as possible.

2003-12-14 10:58  epaepa

	* filter/tv_remove_some_overlapping: Corrected manual page.

2003-12-14 10:45  epaepa

	* README, Makefile.PL: XML::Writer-0.4.1 is now required.  This
	  release can currently be found only in my CPAN author directory,
	  but I hope the same fix (for an annoying warning) can be included
	  in the official version eventually.

2003-12-14 04:11  epaepa

	* t/test_filters.t: If a 'foo.expected_err' file exists, check
	  stderr against it.

2003-12-14 03:50  epaepa

	* t/test_tv_split.t: Whitespace.

2003-12-14 03:48  epaepa

	* t/test_filters.t: Comment.

2003-12-14 02:44  epaepa

	* xmltv.dtd: ISO 3316 is 'assembly tools for screws and nuts'
	  apparently - no idea why I thought it specified language codes.
	  Anyway, we should use RFC 1766.

2003-12-10 14:37  epaepa

	* mkdist, grab/Get_nice.pm, grab/na/ZapListings.pm: Set User-Agent
	  to "xmltv/$XMLTV::VERSION".

2003-12-10 14:30  epaepa

	* grab/: Grab_XML.pm, Memoize.pm, de/tv_grab_de, dk/tv_grab_dk,
	  nl_wolf/tv_grab_nl_wolf, uk/tv_grab_uk.in,
	  uk_rt/tv_grab_uk_rt.in: Refactoring: use XMLTV::Get_nice instead
	  of LWP::Simple, with $Delay = 0 where appropriate.

2003-12-10 13:56  epaepa

	* grab/Get_nice.pm: Let the user change the default five seconds as
	  $Delay.

2003-12-08 23:46  rmeden

	* lib/exe_opt.pl: add perlio::gzip to trim list.  At least until we
	  upgrade EXE to Perl58

2003-12-08 23:45  rmeden

	* Makefile.PL: correct minimum version number of XML::Parser.  3.34
	  doesn't exist 2.34 is current.

2003-12-08 14:00  jskov

	* grab/dk/tv_grab_dk: subtitles fix (by Martin Moeller)

2003-12-07 15:28  epaepa

	* README, doc/README.win32, grab/na/ZapListings.pm,
	  lib/XMLTV.pm.in, Makefile.PL: Version 0.5.25.

2003-12-07 15:08  epaepa

	* grab/dk/tv_grab_dk: Don't set sub-title to '1' on seeing (TH) in
	  listings.  But what does that flag mean?

2003-12-07 14:56  epaepa

	* grab/nz/tv_grab_nz.in: If gen_time fails to parse the start time,
	  do not write the programme.  (This doesn't seem to be happening
	  at the moment.)

2003-12-07 10:15  epaepa

	* Makefile.PL: HTML::Parser 3.34 is required for tv_grab_na because
	  it may fix the segfaults some people have seen.

2003-12-06 13:00  epaepa

	* grab/na/tv_grab_na: Tolerate leading and trailing whitespace in
	  configuration file lines.  If a bad line is found, include it in
	  the error message.

2003-12-06 09:29  epaepa

	* filter/tv_grep.in: Spelling.

2003-12-06 04:54  epaepa

	* MANIFEST, Makefile.PL, README, doc/QuickStart: Removed
	  tv_grab_sn.

2003-12-06 04:36  epaepa

	* grab/sn/tv_grab_sn: This grabber has been blocked by the upstream
	  site, so it no longer works.

2003-11-30 11:40  epaepa

	* Makefile.PL, README, doc/README.win32, grab/na/ZapListings.pm,
	  lib/XMLTV.pm.in: Version 0.5.24.

2003-11-29 16:17  epaepa

	* lib/IMDB.pm: Realized why getstore() appeared to succeed without
	  generating a file - I was checking the return status wrongly.  It
	  returns an http status, not true/false.

	  If --download is given (in other words, we are starting from
	  scratch with no data files), create the IMDB directory if needed.

	  Added some vertical space to warning messages.

2003-11-29 14:44  epaepa

	* lib/IMDB.pm: Catch the case when LWP::Simple::getstore() reports
	  success but did not create the output file.

2003-11-29 10:28  jveldhuis

	* lib/IMDB.pm: default for star-ratings is to not replace added
	  stubs to control if 'date' field will get updated or not fixed
	  url field so it properly identifies duplicates.  fixed categories
	  where if any categories exists, nothing was added.

2003-11-29 05:33  epaepa

	* grab/Europe_TZ.pm: parse_eur_date(): more robust handling of bad
	  date passed in.

	  dst_dates(): now private to this module (it was not used anywhere
	  else), so die() instead of croak() on error.

2003-11-29 05:31  epaepa

	* grab/dk/tv_grab_dk: get_courteous(): call get_courteous_aux()
	  with a single scalar argument, to make extra sure of scalar
	  context.

	  tidy(): new routine, similar to that in many other grabbers, to
	  clean up illegal characters in the site's HTML.

	  More robust handling of dates.

2003-11-29 04:37  epaepa

	* lib/Gunzip.pm: zlib_gunzip_open(): check return value from tie.

2003-11-29 04:26  epaepa

	* README, lib/Gunzip.pm: XMLTV::Gunzip uses PerlIO::gzip, if
	  available, for reading .gz files - much faster than making a tied
	  filehandle from Compress::Zlib.

2003-11-29 03:41  epaepa

	* lib/IMDB.pm: Comment.

2003-11-29 03:40  epaepa

	* Makefile.PL: Require XML::Parsser 2.34 - see
	  <http://rt.cpan.org/NoAuth/Bug.html?id=4501>.

2003-11-28 19:04  jveldhuis

	* filter/tv_imdb: fixed help/usage message

2003-11-28 19:03  jveldhuis

	* lib/IMDB.pm: cosmetic message changes, added note about errors in
	  stage 7 are normal and unlink .offline file before stage7 sanity
	  checks

2003-11-28 14:54  jveldhuis

	* lib/IMDB.pm: pretty things up and manually track linecounts since
	  Gunzip.pm does not set \$.

2003-11-26 08:53  jveldhuis

	* lib/IMDB.pm: Found genres fail to parse bug in 0.5.23.

	  Turns out I had the header string in a regular expression with
	  the o flag so it was only getting compiled twice. This would have
	  been okay if the subroutine wasn't being used for both the Movies
	  list and the Genres list.

2003-11-22 12:42  epaepa

	* grab/sn/tv_grab_sn: Accept new HTML 'class' names from site -
	  thanks to everyone who pointed out the change.

2003-11-22 06:34  epaepa

	* Makefile.PL: Not all versions of pod2text take an input and
	  output filename, so use redirection.

2003-11-22 06:23  epaepa

	* Makefile.PL: Prompt about README.win32.

2003-11-22 06:22  epaepa

	* doc/README.win32: Updated release notes, mentioning tv_imdb
	  problems.

2003-11-19 15:40  epaepa

	* Makefile.PL, README, doc/README.win32, grab/na/ZapListings.pm,
	  lib/XMLTV.pm.in: Version 0.5.23.

2003-11-19 15:31  epaepa

	* todo/TASKS.epa: Another todo item.

2003-11-19 15:28  epaepa

	* filter/tv_imdb: Respect --download flag no matter what
	  preparation stage is chosen.

2003-11-19 15:04  epaepa

	* grab/uk_rt/tv_grab_uk_rt.in: Patches from Edward Wildgoose:
	  enable --output option (which seems to have worked all along);
	  more robust handling of categories; handle deaf-signed and
	  audio-described by adding to description; include URL in warning
	  message; deal more gracefully with pages that explicitly have no
	  programmes available.

2003-11-19 14:59  epaepa

	* grab/uk_rt/tv_grab_uk_rt.in: Don't output (or warn about)
	  duplicate <sub-title>s.

2003-11-19 14:52  epaepa

	* grab/uk/: channel_ids, channel_pkgs/NTL/digital/movies,
	  channel_pkgs/Sky/Movies_World: The Sky movie channels have
	  reappeared under different numbers.

2003-11-19 14:47  epaepa

	* Makefile.PL: Fixed to work with older Getopt::Long versions.

2003-11-18 20:47  jveldhuis

	* lib/IMDB.pm: moved come FUTURE/BUG comments local to
	  alternativeTitles subroutine

2003-11-18 19:34  jveldhuis

	* grab/na/ZapListings.pm: slight change to zap2it site causing
	  failures

2003-11-18 09:28  jveldhuis

	* lib/IMDB.pm: added some version checking to fail nicer with
	  instructions

2003-11-18 00:14  jveldhuis

	* filter/tv_imdb: added star-ratings and genres to categories - now
	  has 7 stages

2003-11-18 00:13  jveldhuis

	* lib/IMDB.pm: added star-ratings and genres to the mix

2003-11-16 12:10  jveldhuis

	* lib/IMDB.pm: added bug description

2003-11-16 11:52  jveldhuis

	* lib/IMDB.pm: added more info to moviedb.info file - file
	  locations and sizes

2003-11-14 19:28  jveldhuis

	* lib/IMDB.pm: bug - directors and actors only updated if its
	  replacing or updating an existing list

2003-11-09 14:10  epaepa

	* Makefile.PL, README, doc/README.win32, grab/na/ZapListings.pm,
	  lib/XMLTV.pm.in: Version 0.5.22.

2003-11-09 13:49  epaepa

	* grab/nz/tv_grab_nz.in: Remove carriage returns from output.

2003-11-09 13:16  epaepa

	* grab/uk_rt/tv_grab_uk_rt.in: get_url(): throw an exception if the
	  page cannot be downloaded rather than returning undef.  This
	  interacts better with memoization.

2003-11-09 11:55  epaepa

	* grab/uk_rt/tv_grab_uk_rt.in: Remove BS characters if they appear
	  in downloaded HTML (Brian Collins reported this can sometimes
	  happen).

2003-11-08 11:37  epaepa

	* Makefile.PL: windows_dist: ported to work on Windows (I hope).

2003-11-08 08:43  epaepa

	* Makefile.PL: windows_dist: generate documentation directly with
	  pod2text, rather than from the installed man pages.

2003-11-08 08:23  epaepa

	* Makefile.PL: Fixed rather dangerous bug (well, a bug in
	  MakeMaker, made dangerous by this code) of rm -rf'ing
	  $(INSTALLBIN) - that directory may not have the same PREFIX as
	  other stuff.

2003-11-08 06:57  epaepa

	* grab/: es/tv_grab_es, fi/tv_grab_fi, hu/tv_grab_hu,
	  it/tv_grab_it.in, sn/tv_grab_sn: Give the 'base' timezone for
	  Europe_TZ as a numeric not named timezone.  This is (hopefully)
	  the last bit of work for Sourceforge bug/feature #834143.

2003-11-08 06:55  epaepa

	* grab/uk_rt/tv_grab_uk_rt.in: Use numeric timezones.  Handle a few
	  more bits of description.

	* grab/uk/tv_grab_uk.in: Use numeric timezones; change the upstream
	  data with tz_to_num().

	  Removed ud(), which was never called.

2003-11-08 06:53  epaepa

	* grab/nl_wolf/tv_grab_nl_wolf: Fix timezones from the upstream
	  data with tz_to_num().

2003-11-08 06:52  epaepa

	* grab/uk/: channel_ids, channel_pkgs/shop: Two channels that
	  disappeared have now reappeared: I've marked them as transient to
	  suppress warnings in future.

2003-11-08 06:51  epaepa

	* grab/Europe_TZ.pm: Comment.

2003-11-08 06:37  epaepa

	* grab/nz/tv_grab_nz.in: It can sometimes be useful to give a
	  negative offset, and it seems to work.

2003-11-08 06:01  epaepa

	* lib/TZ.pm: Work around bug in ParseDate()'s handling of numeric
	  timezones.  Added some trace code.

2003-11-07 13:08  epaepa

	* filter/tv_remove_some_overlapping: When a programme could be
	  removed because of partitioning, but isn't because we don't want
	  to throw away information, print a warning.

	  <url> is a boring subelement of <programme> and shouldn't stop
	  one being discarded.

2003-11-03 13:50  epaepa

	* Makefile.PL, README, doc/README.win32, grab/na/ZapListings.pm,

2003-11-02 15:37  epaepa

	* grab/uk/: channel_ids, channel_pkgs/film, channel_pkgs/gratis,
	  channel_pkgs/shop, channel_pkgs/sport, channel_pkgs/travel,

	  Removed some channels which are no longer on the site.

2003-11-02 15:19  epaepa

	* grab/nz/tv_grab_nz.in: Fixed to work (again) with Python 1.5.
	  Handle series title included as what looks like a 'part'.

2003-11-02 15:18  epaepa

	* grab/hu/tv_grab_hu: Fixed crash when (for some reason I haven't
	  investigated) the result of $txt->content_list() contains plain
	  scalars.

2003-11-02 15:17  epaepa

	* MANIFEST: Adding test_remove_some_overlapping test files which I
	  committed earlier.

2003-11-02 10:35  jveldhuis

	  exact.

	  if stage5 fails, database is now offline and says so when tv_imdb
	  is run in a non-prep mode later.

	  stage 3 now tracks narrators and hosts and puts them in output
	  credits as commentator and presenter.

	  added control over what elements are updated and replaced, but
	  haven't added support in tv_imdb to set/get these. New defaults,
	  to not replace title, but prepend imdb version, same for urls,
	  default to replacing directors, presenters and commentators but
	  only prepend actors to the list and preserve others.

	  Category entries now include lang=en.

	  URLs fixed to use http://us.imdb.com/M/title-exact cgi at
	  imdb.com so the urls get us directly to the movie page on imdb
	  instead of possibly a list of matches.

2003-10-13 13:57  epaepa

	* t/test_filters.t: Set $ENV{LANG} to 'en' before running tests.
	  Kenneth Pronovici discovered (from a Debian bug report) that
	  tv_to_latex's behaviour and therefore its test suite is affected
	  by language.

2003-10-13 13:25  epaepa

	* Makefile.PL: Corrected share directory stored in installed files.
	  It should not include $(DESTDIR).

2003-10-12 11:49  epaepa

	* Makefile.PL: When pasting in bits of Makefile, respect $(DESTDIR)
	  as well as $(PREFIX).  The Perl variable $location holds a
	  fragment of Makefile concatenating those two directories.
	  (Sourceforge bug #82002)

	  Disabled tv_grab_de (I thought this change was committed before).

2003-10-12 11:35  epaepa

	* todo/xmltv-0.6.dtd: Added audio-described, kinda the dual of
	  deaf-signed.

2003-10-12 10:17  epaepa

	* lib/XMLTV.pm.in: parse_callback(): Fixed prototype, as pointed
	  out by Christophe Beauregard.

2003-09-28 14:17  jveldhuis

	* mkdist: added compression to cvs commands

2003-09-28 14:16  jveldhuis

	* README: updated date line

2003-09-28 13:08  epaepa

	* grab/sn/tv_grab_sn: process_table(): refactoring: first put the
	  raw programme hashes into a list, then go through and replace
	  raw_start and raw_stop with real times, then remove zero-length
	  programmes and write.

2003-09-28 03:32  epaepa

	* README: Corrected description of tv_grab_de.

2003-09-27 13:06  jveldhuis

	* README: updated

2003-09-27 13:05  jveldhuis

	* grab/na/tv_grab_na: errorMessage() method was having @_ converted
	  to a scalar in the say() call. So error messages were getting
	  converted to '1'.

2003-09-27 12:21  jveldhuis

	* Makefile.PL, doc/README.win32, grab/na/ZapListings.pm,
	  lib/XMLTV.pm.in: version number updated to 0.5.19

2003-09-27 12:20  jveldhuis

	* README: added release notes for 0.5.19 release

2003-09-27 11:54  jveldhuis

	* grab/na/ZapListings.pm: new manditory sleep(5) before retries

2003-09-27 11:53  jveldhuis

	* grab/na/tv_grab_na: new minimum of 2 second retry-delay enforced

2003-09-27 04:29  epaepa

	* grab/sn/tv_grab_sn: Don't write guessed stop times, write only
	  data that comes from the site.  The detection of midnight
	  crossing is now a bit more intelligent and fires only for
	  programmes within 15000 seconds either side of midnight, and in
	  any case only once per page.

	  This kind of thing really ought to be shared among grabbers.

2003-09-26 13:28  epaepa

	* grab/sn/tv_grab_sn: In any single page of listings, allow only
	  the first case of stop < start to be a crossing of midnight; in
	  later cases the dodgy stop time is discarded.

	  This hasn't made any difference to the output with my config, but
	  Oscar Carlsson found some cases where the grabber did wrongly
	  split listings over several days.

2003-09-25 16:21  epaepa

	* grab/uk_rt/tv_grab_uk_rt.in: Add unknown bits of text to the
	  first description by default.  Improved (needlessly, it turns
	  out) the reporting of date mismatches.

2003-09-25 16:09  epaepa

	* grab/fi/tv_grab_fi: Remove a bad character (205) that's gotten
	  into the data.

2003-09-25 16:01  epaepa

	* grab/it/tv_grab_it.in: Warn if known-bad channels are mentioned
	  in the config file.

	  Fixed --days so that it it should work correctly with --offset.
	  (--days should always be the number of days downloaded, from
	  --offset onwards.)

	  Always warn if a downloaded page contains no programmes, and
	  always skip a whole channel if this happens for the first day.

2003-09-25 15:28  epaepa

	* grab/uk/: channel_ids, tv_grab_uk.in: Added a new field
	  'transient' to the channel_ids file, to suppress warnings for
	  certain channels which are known to appear and disappear on the
	  site.

2003-09-25 15:11  epaepa

	* grab/uk/tv_grab_uk.in: Cut down on the number of warnings for
	  channels in the config files but not on the site.

2003-09-14 11:43  epaepa

	* grab/nl/tv_grab_nl: Spelling.

2003-09-14 11:41  epaepa

	* grab/nl/tv_grab_nl: Handle a few more Dutch strings following
	  advice from Martijn Vernooij.

2003-09-14 09:27  epaepa

	* todo/xmltv-0.6.dtd: Added will-repeat, will-repeat-date and
	  will-repeat-channel to store partial information about when a
	  programme will be shown again.

2003-09-13 13:34  epaepa

	* Makefile.PL, README, doc/README.win32, grab/na/ZapListings.pm,
	  lib/XMLTV.pm.in: Version 0.5.18.

2003-09-13 04:55  epaepa

	* grab/nl_wolf/tv_grab_nl_wolf: Remove stop times which are before
	  the start time.

2003-09-13 04:29  epaepa

	* grab/hu/tv_grab_hu: Don't guess stop times based on the 'next'
	  programme on the site: these are often wrong and lead to nonsense
	  like programmes that stop before they start or overlap with other
	  programmes on the same channel.  If the site does not provide
	  stop times explicitly, it's better to omit them and let the user
	  add them with a tool like tv_sort if he wants guessed stop times.

2003-09-13 03:36  epaepa

	* grab/uk/: channel_ids, channel_pkgs/adult,
	  channel_pkgs/lifestyle, channel_pkgs/music,
	  channel_pkgs/regional, channel_pkgs/NTL/digital/Family,
	  channel_pkgs/Sky/Family: Added some new channels.

2003-09-13 03:32  epaepa

	* todo/xmltv-0.6.dtd: Added new <remark> element to store text
	  associated with a programme but not describing that programme -
	  for example, a recommendation not to miss some other show if you
	  liked this one.

2003-09-13 03:24  epaepa

	* grab/uk_rt/tv_grab_uk_rt.in: Fixed some progress messages:
	  they're not appropriate to display with say(), they should be
	  printed on stderr as before.	It would be better to have a single
	  progress bar, however.

	  Handle a few more random bits of text appearing in listings - but
	  these new ones are just added to the end of the programme
	  description.

2003-09-13 03:05  epaepa

	* grab/it/tv_grab_it.in: Make channel ids lowercase, like domain
	  names.

2003-09-13 03:03  epaepa

	* grab/it/tv_grab_it.in: Moved domain name guidatv.libero.it into
	  $domain.

2003-09-12 16:04  epaepa

	* grab/it/dud_channels: Updated for new channel ids
	  (guidatv.libero.it); added dud channel 102.5.

2003-09-12 15:24  epaepa

	* grab/it/tv_grab_it.in: Reformatted code in preparation for
	  patching.

2003-09-12 14:46  epaepa

	* grab/na/ZapListings.pm: Removed a line of chatter on stderr.

2003-09-10 23:43  rmeden

	* lib/exe_opt.pl: add some more excludes for bogus missing module
	  messages

2003-09-10 13:49  epaepa

	* lib/Ask.pm: Disable graphical config unless the XMLTV_TK
	  environment variable is set to a true value.

2003-09-09 13:54  epaepa

	* grab/na/ZapListings.pm: Following speculation on the mailing
	  list, use index() and substr() for manipulation of the
	  channel-list page rather than regular expressions in an attempt
	  to avoid a segfault.

	  index_bothcases(): wrapper for index() that tries the substring
	  in both lowercase and uppercase (though not all combinations of
	  the two).

2003-09-09 13:16  epaepa

	* grab/na/ZapListings.pm: Added some warnings in a couple of cases
	  where functions fail by returning a special value.

	  Check the result of a call to URI->new_abs() and to GET().

2003-09-09 12:33  epaepa

	* grab/na/ZapListings.pm: Form2Request(): reformatted code in
	  preparation for patching.

2003-09-08 14:22  epaepa

	* grab/na/ZapListings.pm: Fixed some seemingly-buggy code looking
	  for a case-insensitive substring.

	  More error checking: in particular make sure some
	  possibly-infinite loops do terminate, and fail earlier if a URL
	  request object cannot be made.

2003-09-08 14:03  epaepa

	* grab/na/ZapListings.pm: Changed all calls to main::errorMessage()
	  to use warn() instead.  This is because there's currently a
	  strange bug where errorMessage() was not printing anything, and
	  there are other more important bugs to fix first, so the first
	  priority is to get working error reporting.  Although I think
	  that in the long run warn() may prove to be more appropriate,
	  since many of the messages are technical and not something for
	  the end user.

	  getZipCodeForm(): added 'category' to the form settings, zap2it
	  seem to have started including it.

2003-09-07 05:58  epaepa

	* grab/na/tv_grab_na: Print a status message if we get the channel
	  list successfully (which we might not, given the current
	  segfault).

	  Fail more cleanly if askQuestion() for service provider returns
	  undef.  But really, it should throw an exception rather than
	  returning that.

2003-09-06 13:14  epaepa

	* grab/de/tv_grab_de: Added a warning that the grabber is currently
	  not working.

	  XMLTV::Ask now has two implementations, AskTerm and AskTk, and
	  chooses one based on whether Tk is usable.  The grabbers need to
	  use the XMLTV::Ask routines exclusively when they want to
	  communicate with the user; in particular this means the new say()
	  routine rather than print().

	  I haven't tested the Tk configuration half yet.

2003-08-28 13:46  epaepa

	* grab/nz/tv_grab_nz.in: Patch from James Sleeman to extract
	  episode titles, except for certain titles mentioned in the
	  episode_names file.

	  Also changed to turn 'Movie: ' into a category.

2003-08-26 15:03  epaepa

	* Makefile.PL: Version 0.5.17.

2003-08-26 15:00  epaepa

	* README, doc/README.win32, grab/na/ZapListings.pm,
	  lib/XMLTV.pm.in: Version 0.5.17.

2003-08-26 14:40  epaepa

	* grab/nz/tv_grab_nz.in: Re-enabled tv_grab_nz as it seems to be
	  working again (though not perhaps 100% of the time).

2003-08-24 21:36  rmeden

	* choose/tv_check/: tv_check, tv_check_doc.html: add --bluenew
	  option to highlight non-repeat episodes

2003-08-17 09:10  epaepa

	* Makefile.PL, README: Reinstated tv_grab_nz, it is now working
	  again.

2003-08-17 08:01  epaepa

	* lib/Ask.pm: Reformatted @EXPORT with one word per line - this
	  makes it easier to diff and patch.

2003-08-17 03:31  epaepa

	* t/test_filters.t: When a command fails, report the arguments as
	  well.

2003-08-17 03:18  epaepa

	* lib/IMDB.pm: When files have been automatically downloaded, don't
	  then warn about them being missing.

2003-08-17 03:11  epaepa

	* lib/TZ.pm: Added trace messages; corrected comment.

2003-08-17 03:07  epaepa

	* grab/Config_file.pm: Give an error for seemingly empty config
	  files.

2003-08-17 03:06  epaepa

	* filter/tv_grep.in: More log messages.

2003-08-17 03:05  epaepa

	* mkdist: Remove .cvsignore files from the release as well as CVS/
	  directories.

2003-08-16 04:01  epaepa

	* grab/na/tv_grab_na: Updated documentation now that
	  --list-providers and --list-channels work standalone.

2003-08-16 03:55  epaepa

	* grab/na/tv_grab_na: --list-provders and --list-channels don't
	  require --configure to be given separately.

2003-08-16 03:22  epaepa

	* doc/README.win32: Updated for 0.5.16 release.  This file needs to
	  be self-contained because at the moment 'make windows_dist'
	  installs it as the README for the Windows distribution and leaves
	  out the source code README.  Maybe we can change this for a later
	  release.

2003-08-16 03:15  epaepa

	* Makefile.PL: Added --yes option to choose to install everything,
	  and --nodeps to write the Makefile even if dependencies are
	  missing.  These help with building the Windows distribution.

2003-08-14 15:14  epaepa

	* README: Whoops, forgot to update the signature line.

2003-08-14 15:11  epaepa

	* Makefile.PL, README, doc/README.win32, grab/na/ZapListings.pm,
	  lib/XMLTV.pm.in: Version 0.5.15.

2003-08-14 15:00  epaepa

	* Makefile.PL, grab/nz/tv_grab_nz.in: Disabling tv_grab_nz since I
	  don't have time to fix it right now and we need a new release to
	  fix tv_grab_na.

2003-08-13 07:37  rmeden

	* doc/README.win32: updated README to include current windows tips

2003-08-13 00:17  rmeden

	* grab/na/ZapListings.pm: zap2it is returninga status code of 500
	  even though the listings are in the response. Dane Kanter has
	  released a patched ZapListings.PM which I am merging into the
	  current CVS here.  There is still a problem, only 20 channels are
	  return, but it's better than nothing.

2003-08-09 16:40  epaepa

	* xmltv.dtd: Corrected UT to UTC.

2003-08-05 09:34  jveldhuis

	* grab/na/: ZapListings.pm, tv_grab_na: --output now redirects
	  --list-providers and --list-channels output in --configure mode.

	  HDTV occuring in listing now appears at end of description (since
	  we don't have a proper place for it) and also triggers an aspect
	  ratio in the video stanza to be 16:9.

2003-08-04 16:17  jveldhuis

	* grab/na/ZapListings.pm: workaround for HDTV qualifiers getting in
	  the road of star ratings in the description

2003-07-31 14:24  epaepa

	* grab/uk/tv_grab_uk.in: Calculate $now (for the midnight sanity
	  check) at run time, and after Date_Init() has been called.  This
	  should fix the bug found by Stephen Foster that the grabber
	  required TZ to be set.

2003-07-29 14:56  epaepa

	* Makefile.PL: Fixed to work with newer versions of MakeMaker,
	  which define a FIRST_MAKEFILE variable.

2003-07-27 06:43  epaepa

	* todo/xmltv-0.6.dtd: Reinstated 'newness' with values 'repeat',
	  'premiere' and 'new-show', because there are now two bits of
	  information to associate with a repeat (date and channel).  They
	  can't both go in the content of a single attribute, so we need
	  separate 'repeat-date' and 'repeat-channel' attributes.

2003-07-27 06:21  epaepa

	* todo/xmltv-0.6.dtd: Allow nth="last" in <episode-details>, for
	  cases when the total number is not known.

2003-07-27 06:07  epaepa

	* todo/xmltv-0.6.dtd: Split 'newness' into 'repeat', 'new' and
	  'last-chance' attribures.  The content of 'repeat' gives the
	  channel of the previous showing.

2003-07-27 05:30  epaepa

	* todo/xmltv-0.6.dtd: Clarified the meaning of 'original-air-date'.

2003-07-25 09:47  rmeden

	* choose/tv_check/tv_check_doc.html: document wildcard scans
	  document --notruncate option

2003-07-25 09:47  rmeden

	* choose/tv_check/tv_check: add --notruncate option to allow
	  title-scans more than 7 days away

2003-07-25 09:41  rmeden

	* choose/tv_check/.cvsignore: [no log message]

2003-07-25 09:41  rmeden

	* choose/tv_check/.cvsignore: Updated by TortoiseCVS

2003-07-25 09:28  rmeden

	* choose/tv_check/tv_check: case sensitivity to title-scans have
	  been put back in.  a case insensitive wildcard title search
	  capability has been adde

2003-07-25 08:21  rmeden

	* choose/tv_check/tv_check: make Title-Search case insensitive

2003-07-24 13:13  jveldhuis

	* lib/IMDB.pm: update estimate to reflect latest counts

2003-07-20 10:22  epaepa

	* grab/: dk/tv_grab_dk, es/tv_grab_es, fi/tv_grab_fi,
	  hu/tv_grab_hu, it/tv_grab_it.in, na/tv_grab_na, nl/tv_grab_nl,
	  sn/tv_grab_sn: Changed grabbers to use
	  XMLTV::Ask::askManyBooleanQuestions() for handling 'none' and
	  'all' answers.

2003-07-20 10:18  epaepa

	* lib/Ask.pm: askManyBooleanQuestions(): carp() about the mistake
	  of passing 'no' as the default instead of 0 (since the string
	  'no' is false).

2003-07-20 09:13  epaepa

	* grab/na/tv_grab_na: Refactored some duplicate code in
	  configuration.

2003-07-20 06:49  epaepa

	* lib/Ask.pm: askManyBooleanQuestions(): Offer both 'all' and
	  'none' options regardless of the default answer.

2003-07-19 10:28  epaepa

	* grab/na/ZapListings.pm: Say 'use base' instead of 'require' plus
	  '@ISA ='.

2003-07-19 10:28  epaepa

	* grab/uk/tv_grab_uk.in: Now that perl-5.6 is required we no longer
	  need the Tie::RefHash::Nestable workaround.

2003-07-19 10:15  epaepa

	* Makefile.PL, Uninstall.pm, mkdist, attic/html_parsing,
	  choose/tv_pick/tv_pick_cgi, filter/Grep.pm,
	  filter/tv_extractinfo_en, filter/tv_sort, grab/Europe_TZ.pm,

	  lib/Gunzip.pm, lib/IMDB.pm, lib/Summarize.pm, lib/TZ.pm,
	  lib/Usage.pm, lib/XMLTV.pm.in, t/parallel_test, t/test_filters.t:
	  Say 'our' instead of 'use vars'.  Changes checked by hand but not
	  every program has been run ('make test' passes).

2003-07-19 08:51  epaepa

	* grab/it/tv_grab_it.PL, grab/nz/tv_grab_nz.PL,
	  grab/uk/tv_grab_uk.PL, lib/set_share_dir.pl: set_share_dir.pl now
	  provides a set_share_dir() function to call with two arguments,
	  rather than using a global $in variable and @ARGV.

2003-07-19 06:24  epaepa

	* t/test_filters.t: Allow extra arguments as regexps for tests to
	  run, so you can say for example './t/test_filters.t --full
	  tv_sort'.

2003-07-14 20:25  rmeden

	* choose/tv_check/tv_check: fix some more loose ends on channel
	  name changes

2003-07-14 14:56  epaepa

	* xmltv.dtd: Clarified the meaning of the 'part number' field in
	  xmltvns episode-nums.

2003-07-12 14:51  epaepa

	* Makefile.PL, filter/tv_sort: Replaced data_eq() in tv_sort with
	  the Storable module, which can be used to implement deep equality
	  testing.

2003-07-12 10:48  epaepa

	* grab/uk_rt/tv_grab_uk_rt.in: When an unknown bit of text is very
	  long, it's probably an extra description or review.

2003-07-12 10:48  epaepa

	* grab/nz/tv_grab_nz.in: Handle part numbers like 'P2' (I hope this
	  does express a part number and isn't junk text).

2003-07-10 23:46  rmeden

	* choose/tv_check/tv_check: keep up with tv_grab_na's changes to
	  the channel name field.  It's used to auto-convert from the old
	  tv_grab_na id format to new RFC format.  Once the the show file
	  is written again, the new id values are stored.

2003-07-10 15:18  epaepa

	* mkdist: Check the date in the README file before release.

2003-07-06 13:13  epaepa

	* Makefile.PL, README, doc/README.win32, grab/na/ZapListings.pm,
	  lib/XMLTV.pm.in: Version 0.5.15.

2003-07-06 13:12  epaepa

	* grab/uk_rt/tv_grab_uk_rt.in: Handle (or rather explicitly
	  do-not-handle) another piece of information on the site,
	  'subsequent programmes may be altered or late'.

2003-07-06 12:39  epaepa

	* grab/nz/tv_grab_nz.in: get_programs(): If there's a failure
	  downloading the URL, warn about it and return nothing (rather
	  than aborting).

2003-07-06 11:12  epaepa

	* grab/nl_wolf/tv_grab_nl_wolf: Fixed for change in the layout of
	  the index page on the upstream site.

2003-07-06 10:46  epaepa

	* grab/nl/tv_grab_nl: process_summary_page(): Refactored parsing of
	  dates: annotate @todo with start day and stop day and then parse
	  each element of it afterwards.

2003-07-06 10:21  epaepa

	* grab/nl/tv_grab_nl: The code to work out when a midnight crossing
	  should be placed was wrong because it wasn't comparing
	  Date::Manip's deltas correctly.  You have to use Delta_Format()
	  before you can compare them - I chose to format them as a number
	  of seconds.

	  This fixes the problem found by Paul Webster where Sport from
	  12:30 to 00:00 would bump the day, giving the wrong day for all
	  the following programmes that were contained inside Sport.  But
	  it does so almost by accident.

2003-07-06 07:20  epaepa

	* lib/IMDB.pm: Now uses XMLTV::Gunzip to open gzipped files.

	  openMaybeGunzip(): new routine to factor out code of gunzipping
	  or opening normally depending on file extension.

2003-07-06 07:02  epaepa

	* lib/Gunzip.pm: This module now provides a way to open .gz files
	  as well as decompressing data in memory.  The opening works by
	  using gzopen() and a simple Tie::Handle wrapper to make
	  Compress::Zlib look like a filehandle.  This code ought to be
	  part of Compress::Zlib itself one day.  If the module is not
	  installed then of course we open a pipe from gzip.

2003-07-05 12:34  epaepa

	* MANIFEST, Makefile.PL, grab/de/tv_grab_de, lib/Gunzip.pm: Moved
	  the code to call Compress::Zlib-or-gzip(1) out of tv_grab_de into
	  a new library XMLTV::Gunzip.

2003-07-05 11:51  epaepa

	* todo/xmltv-0.6.dtd: Added a TODO.

2003-07-05 10:35  jveldhuis

	* grab/na/tv_grab_na: display-name changed from:
	  <diplay-name>Channel 2 CFRN</display-name> to    <display-name>2
	  CFRN</display-name>	 <display-name>2</display-name> to be more
	  consistant with other grabbers and give applications the option
	  of looking for a numeric display-name

2003-07-05 08:57  epaepa

	* todo/xmltv-0.6.dtd: Added <tz-hint> which lets applications
	  convert times into an appropriate timezone to show to the user,
	  even though the times in the XML file are always UTC.  (But
	  documented that code-times for systems like VPS and PDC, which
	  are really just magic numbers, may be in a local timezone.)

	  Decided that newline is treated the same as space; this is
	  consistent with HTML and a bit saner than the old DTD's
	  prohibition of newline.

	  Added an 'id' element to <programme> and created <programme-ref>
	  to refer to it.  Programme-refs can appear inside a timeslot the
	  same way programmes can.  But they must refer to a programme
	  defined earlier in the file (to allow for lazy reading).

	  Stopped misuse of <desc> inside <link> - it was a good idea at
	  first, but then we added 'type of desc' which made it specific to
	  programmes.

	  Documented the <number> element, it was there all along but I
	  hadn't decided what it meant.  It can store any kind of channel
	  number, usually the button you'd press on your television, but
	  also application-defined things depending on the 'system'
	  attribute.  I don't really want to make it any more complicated
	  than that.

2003-07-05 00:58  rmeden

	* lib/IMDB.pm: change from LWP::Simple::getprint to getstore.
	  getprint converts line endings on MacOS and windows, and this
	  screws up the gziped listing files. In addition, getstore doesn't
	  need all the games with STDOUT.

2003-07-03 15:21  epaepa

	* Makefile.PL, README: The complicated testing of Date::Manip
	  should no longer be needed, version 5.42 incorporates the fixes
	  we want so we can just require that.

2003-07-03 15:20  epaepa

	* lib/TZ.pm: Changed a few die()s to croak() when they are the
	  caller's fault.

2003-07-03 15:19  epaepa

	* grab/Europe_TZ.pm: parse_eur_date(): added usage check.

2003-07-03 14:51  epaepa

	* grab/de/tv_grab_de: The upstream timezones are incorrect, don't
	  rely on them but use Europe_TZ instead.

2003-07-02 17:58  jveldhuis

	* Makefile.PL: reversed an accidental check-in that removed the
	  checks for Date::Manip versions

2003-07-01 13:01  jveldhuis

	* Makefile.PL: version 0.5.14 numbers

2003-07-01 12:56  jveldhuis

	* lib/XMLTV.pm.in: version 0.5.14 numbers

2003-07-01 12:50  jveldhuis

	* Makefile.PL, README, doc/README.win32, grab/na/ZapListings.pm:
	  version 0.5.14 numbers

2003-07-01 12:47  jveldhuis

	* grab/na/ZapListings.pm: arg s//ios doesn't default to global case
	  insensitive, only the first match

2003-07-01 10:45  jveldhuis

	* grab/na/ZapListings.pm: updated release information in useragent

2003-07-01 10:44  jveldhuis

	* mkdist: put back in cvs tagging

2003-07-01 10:43  jveldhuis

	* Makefile.PL, README, doc/README.win32, lib/XMLTV.pm.in: updated
	  version numbers and descriptions for 0.5.13 release

2003-07-01 10:20  jveldhuis

	* grab/na/ZapListings.pm: the fix required to support the new
	  zap2it web layout.  Big Big thanks to Gregorio Gervasio who
	  sumitted most of the fixes.

2003-06-29 15:15  epaepa

	* Makefile.PL, README, doc/README.win32, grab/na/ZapListings.pm,
	  lib/XMLTV.pm.in: Version 0.5.12.

2003-06-29 14:54  epaepa

	* lib/IMDB.pm: Declare the name 'OLDOUT' to quell warning.

2003-06-29 13:15  epaepa

	* grab/uk_rt/tv_grab_uk_rt.in: The warning about channel names now
	  allows the small difference 'Sky One' -> 'Sky 1', etc.

2003-06-29 13:14  epaepa

	* grab/nl/tv_grab_nl: In --slow mode, deal with a couple of
	  non-Latin-1 characters that creep into the HTML.  A more general
	  character check is still todo.

2003-06-29 13:03  epaepa

	* grab/hu/tv_grab_hu: Trim leading and trailing whitespace from
	  programme titles.

2003-06-29 12:49  epaepa

	* grab/uk/: channel_ids, channel_pkgs/Freeview,
	  channel_pkgs/classics, channel_pkgs/film, channel_pkgs/wales,
	  channel_pkgs/Telewest/Supreme: Updated channel packages after
	  changes on the site.

2003-06-29 09:53  epaepa

	  have '=pod'.	This should let them get noticed by older versions
	  of MakeMaker.

2003-06-29 09:33  epaepa

	* grab/uk/: channel_ids, channel_pkgs/film,
	  channel_pkgs/NTL/digital/movies, channel_pkgs/Sky/Movies_World:
	  Removed channel widescreen.premier.sky.com, which is no longer on
	  the site.

2003-06-29 09:32  epaepa

	* grab/uk/tv_grab_uk.in: Prompt for 'five main channels' rather
	  than 'terrestrial analogue channels', since nowadays you can get
	  the region'd BBC1 and ITV with digital satellite as well.

	  When warning about unknown channel ids in packages, give the full
	  package filename relative to channel_pkgs/.

2003-06-29 08:51  epaepa

	* grab/de/tv_grab_de: Added 'use bytes' to work around baffling
	  problem reported by Axel Thimm.

	  Remove empty <desc> elements to avoid complaints from XMLTV.pm.

2003-06-29 08:40  epaepa

	* grab/nl/tv_grab_nl: Rewrote --slow mode so that it uses the
	  summary information of 'fast' mode and just adds extra details.
	  This should get rid of the bugs with missing programmes or wrong
	  times in --slow mode.

2003-06-28 12:25  epaepa

	* todo/xmltv-0.6.dtd: Adding 'original air date' for repeated
	  programmes as suggested by Anduin Withers.

2003-06-23 22:32  jveldhuis

	* lib/IMDB.pm: how rude, some entries have (TV) appearing more than
	  once.

2003-06-23 16:57  rmeden

	* choose/tv_check/tv_check.bat: [no log message]

2003-06-22 13:46  epaepa

	* mkdist: Fixed regexp to match xmltv/0.5.11 or whatever in
	  ZapListings.pm.

2003-06-22 13:22  epaepa

	* Makefile.PL, README, mkdist, doc/README.win32,
	  grab/na/ZapListings.pm, lib/XMLTV.pm.in: Version 0.5.11.

	  Added Zaplistings.pm to the version checker in mkdist.

2003-06-22 13:05  epaepa

	* todo/TASKS.epa: Another todo item.

2003-06-22 11:56  epaepa

	* grab/it/tv_grab_it.in: Use get_nice() to download channels page,
	  not get() which is not imported.

2003-06-22 11:54  epaepa

	* grab/it/tv_grab_it.in: Robert E. spotted that --share was broken.

2003-06-22 11:32  epaepa

	* Makefile.PL: Changed description of tv_check as suggested by
	  Robert Eden.

2003-06-22 10:39  rmeden

	* lib/exe_wrap.pl: added tv_grab_it to those programs that need a
	  --share directory

2003-06-22 04:40  epaepa

	* Makefile.PL: More windows_dist fixes: remove useless files and
	  directories.

2003-06-22 04:25  epaepa

	* Makefile.PL: Fixed manual page generation (again).  For some
	  reason $(INSTALLMAN1DIR), which is normally the final resting
	  place of section 1 manual pages, wasn't created at the time
	  windows_dist ran.  Instead we now fetch the pages from
	  $(INST_MAN1DIR), which is the temporary place in blib/, and
	  should always be there.  I hope this doesn't break on anyone
	  else's system with a different MakeMaker.

	  The 'unix2dos' program also has a tendency to misbehave - it can
	  run in two modes, modifying a file in-place or running as a
	  filter and writing the new text to stdout.  My unix2dos seems to
	  have decided to switch from one to the other, so I've replaced it
	  with some Perl code to do the same job.

	* Makefile.PL: Made the prompting for optional things a bit more
	  manageable - you are offered a default configuration to accept.

2003-06-21 14:16  epaepa

	* grab/na/tv_grab_na: Fixed <episode-num> output - the right system
	  is 'xmltv_ns' not 'xmltv', and formatted the data the same way as
	  tv_cat.

2003-06-21 14:12  epaepa

	* grab/fi/tv_grab_fi: Updated for new layout of channel list on
	  front page - the grabber now works again.

2003-06-21 14:02  epaepa

	* grab/uk_rt/tv_grab_uk_rt.in: Handle alternate spellings 'Related
	  websites' and 'Related features'; report the correct URL in error
	  messages.

2003-06-21 13:54  epaepa

	* grab/uk_rt/tv_grab_uk_rt.in: Loosened regexp to match channel
	  list, so the grabber now works again.

2003-06-21 13:45  epaepa

	* grab/nz/tv_grab_nz.in: Parse 'Part 2' etc. and turn it into
	  <episode-num>.

2003-06-21 09:37  epaepa

	* Makefile.PL: Don't create plain text versions of section 3 manual
	  pages for the Windows binary distribution - they are not needed.

	  But where the pages are installed, give them the correct name:
	  XMLTV::Foo rather than just Foo.

2003-06-21 09:07  epaepa

	* Makefile.PL: Fixed windows_dist target: a line was missing.
	  Converted some spaces to tabs (it didn't seem to matter, but
	  might as well be consistent).

2003-06-21 08:44  epaepa

	* MANIFEST: Added merge_tvprefs to file list.

2003-06-21 08:26  epaepa

	* grab/de/tv_grab_de: Fix up the downloaded XML to have
	  proper-looking channel ids and <channel> elements.

2003-06-21 07:02  epaepa

	* grab/nl/tv_grab_nl: Moved most of write_details() into a new
	  routine process_details_page() which returns a programme hash
	  from a single page.  Then write_details()'s job is to track
	  next-day changes and write the programmes.

	  time_van_str(), time_tot_str(): these do now return strings, not
	  Date::Manip objects.

2003-06-21 05:38  epaepa

	* grab/nl/tv_grab_nl: Refactored the calls of summary_page_data()
	  on each of @to_get - the results are needed for both slow and
	  fast modes.

	  Removed detail_urls(), it is not and was not used.

	  Don't warn about empty 'Genre', just skip it.

2003-06-21 04:43  epaepa

	* grab/nl/tv_grab_nl: Trimmed trailing spaces.

2003-06-14 11:26  epaepa

	* Makefile.PL: Version 5.40.epa1 of Date::Manip is now required;
	  added a selection of different verbose error messages explaining
	  what you might or might not need to install.

2003-06-08 12:21  rmeden

	* choose/tv_check/tv_check: added code to automatically convert to
	  new RFC based tv_grab_na channel Ids

	  added code to remove false alarm and "never mind" message when
	  --myrelaytv can't guess a show day, but assumes the old day is
	  ok.

2003-06-08 04:10  epaepa

	* filter/: Grep.pm, tv_grep.in: Fixed bug found by Jeffrey Arundel
	  Ralph and Robert Eden.  An empty regexp does not 'always match',
	  instead it uses the last successfully matching regexp.  This
	  meant it appeared to work for some users but failed for others.
	  Now there is an explicit check for empty regexp whenever one is
	  used.  The strange thing is that this check already existed in
	  some parts of the code, but not everywhere.

2003-06-08 03:47  epaepa

	* choose/tv_pick/merge_tvprefs: Adding trivial merge_tvprefs script
	  to combine two or more prefs files.

2003-06-07 11:09  epaepa

	* choose/tv_pick/tv_pick_cgi: Removed support for very old tvprefs
	  files with 'maybe'.

2003-06-02 21:38  rmeden

	* Makefile.PL: blank lines were left in new windows_dist code.

2003-06-01 23:54  jveldhuis

	* grab/na/tv_grab_na: channel ids now follow RFC2838 as per Ed's
	  request

2003-06-01 15:11  epaepa

	* grab/Europe_TZ.pm: date_to_eur(): Removed unused $clock_shift
	  variable.

2003-06-01 13:44  epaepa

	* todo/xmltv-0.6.dtd: Episode numbers now specify whether they are
	  relative to this season (default) or the show as a whole.

	  The reason for the default attribute value is that I didn't want
	  to leave it ambigous ('episode 7 in unknown') but equally I
	  didn't want to add a comment saying 'if you give the "nth"
	  attribute you must also give "in"'.

2003-06-01 12:31  epaepa

	* grab/nl/tv_grab_nl: process_summary_page(): Rewrote handling of
	  times.  Now instead of taking the first programme with stop <
	  start as the point where the listings cross midnight, all such
	  programmes are compared and the one with the shortest length is
	  taken as the 'real' one (so we ignore things like 'Kilroy
	  10:00-00:00', which is both absurd and all too plausible).  The
	  results returned should now guarantee no programme stops before
	  it starts, and should be in time order.

	  This should fix some of the problems reported by Johan
	  Schravesande.

2003-06-01 10:02  epaepa

	* filter/tv_sort, t/data/tv_sort_all_UTF8.expected,
	  t/data/tv_sort_by_channel_all_UTF8.expected: Fixed a design bug
	  in tv_sort.  Previously, when comparing two programmes, if either
	  of them lacked a stop time then it did not consider stop times
	  and went straight on to comparing other things.  But this makes a
	  bad comparison function: for example three programmes which have
	  the same start time, one of them has no stop time, and the other
	  two have different stop times.  You can see that the <= relation
	  is no longer transitive.  Fixed this by deciding that 'no stop
	  time' comes before 'some stop time'.

	  This meant some changes to add_stop(), the routine which guesses
	  stop times for programmes that don't have them.  This function
	  ought perhaps to be in a separate filter program, but it's still
	  part of tv_sort for now.  add_stop() needs to maintain the
	  invariant that its list of programmes is sorted, so you can't
	  always add stop times because that could now change the sorting
	  order.  But I've rewritten it so it's a bit less tangled than
	  before, I'm fairly sure it's correct, and the results seem about
	  the same as before (except in cases where the old version broke).

2003-06-01 09:55  epaepa

	* MANIFEST: Added new lib/exe_opt.pl to file list.

2003-06-01 09:53  epaepa

	* lib/exe_opt.pl: It's 'xmltv' for the project or maybe 'XMLTV',
	  but definitely not 'xmlTV' :-P.

2003-06-01 09:47  epaepa

	* t/test_filters.t: run(): if system() fails, put STDERR back
	  before trying to report an error!

2003-06-01 04:16  epaepa

	* grab/nl/tv_grab_nl: Skip quietly over the 'Ieder heel uur' and
	  'onder voorbehoud' notices.

2003-06-01 04:02  epaepa

	* Makefile.PL: Make requires tabs not spaces before commands.

2003-06-01 03:12  epaepa

	* lib/XMLTV.pm.in: Remove \r characters when reading input; this is
	  for reading files with CP/M line endings, and should fix some
	  test failures on Windows.

2003-06-01 03:10  epaepa

	* grab/nl/tv_grab_nl: Tidied some code; don't use 'next' to exit a

2003-06-01 02:20  epaepa

	* MANIFEST: A couple of files were recently deleted.

2003-06-01 02:00  epaepa

	* grab/nl/tv_grab_nl: Removed lone mention of
	  $Log::TraceMessages::On which was causing a warning.

2003-06-01 00:22  rmeden

2003-05-31 23:46  rmeden

	  PERLAPP options for for use in making xmltv.exe It's pretty much
	  constants except for the version fields.

2003-05-31 23:44  rmeden

	* Makefile.PL: add version and other meta-data to xmltv.exe

2003-05-31 14:39  epaepa

	* todo/xmltv-0.6.dtd: Added 'uncertain' attribute to <timeslot> for

	  information is provided by tv_grab_nl's listings source.

2003-05-31 12:05  epaepa

	* grab/uk/channel_pkgs/Telewest/: Entry, Essential_Plus: Telewest

2003-05-31 07:34  epaepa

	* filter/tv_grep.in: Added undocumented --echo option which must
	  appear as the first argument and causes tv_grep to dump its

	  bugs on Windows.

2003-05-31 07:30  epaepa

2003-05-30 14:47  epaepa

	* lib/IMDB.pm: Use getprint() to download files without loading the
	  whole file into memory.  (OK, later processing does require
	  loading the whole file, but still, this greater frugality in
	  downloading is useful to me.) Also this lets you keep partially
	  written files, which should be renamed to filename.partial.

2003-05-30 14:21  epaepa

	* filter/tv_imdb: Added --download option which if given in
	  --prepStage sets the new 'downloadMissingFiles' flag for
	  XMLTV::IMDB::Crunch.	Changed documentation to reflect this.

	  Documented the slowness in Windows.

2003-05-30 14:07  epaepa

	* lib/IMDB.pm: new(): the new 'downloadMissingFiles' option turns
	  on a simple-minded attempt to get the files from an imdb FTP
	  site.  This might suffice for users on fast connections.  Create
	  the lists/ directory if it doesn't already exist.

2003-05-30 13:11  epaepa

	* filter/tv_imdb: Documented that IMDB.pm runs an external gzip
	  rather than using Compress::Zlib.

2003-05-30 07:58  rmeden

	* Makefile.PL: fix errors dealing with the MAN pages.

2003-05-29 15:17  epaepa

	* grab/nl/tv_grab_nl: Changed the handling of programmes with
	  missing start and stop times: now process_summary_page() returns
	  what it can (including even programmes with stop time but no
	  start) and there is less inclination to spoil a 'good' programme
	  by putting it in a clump with bad ones.

	  This might or might not satisfactorily solve the problems
	  reported by Johan Schravesande.

2003-05-26 08:47  epaepa

	* doc/README.win32: Noted that ^ is the quote character on some
	  Windows versions.

2003-05-26 05:49  epaepa

	* Makefile.PL: Dealt with FIXME: replaced Unix commands (other than
	  echo(1)) with invocations of ExtUtils::Command.  This should
	  improve portability, particularly to Windows.

2003-05-26 03:45  epaepa

	* Makefile.PL, doc/README.win32: Documented date formats for
	  xmltv.exe users in a generated file date_formats.txt.

2003-05-26 03:42  epaepa

	* filter/tv_split: Removed reference to nonexistent xmltv(5)
	  manpage.

2003-05-24 23:31  rmeden

	* lib/exe_wrap.pl: remove error on directory with space in it...
	  doesn't seem to be a problem now

2003-05-22 14:45  epaepa

	* Makefile.PL: Made the configuration process more consistent by
	  having every grabber optional.  Only the XMLTV libraries and
	  filter programs are required.

2003-05-22 14:14  epaepa

	* Makefile.PL: Made all occurrences of tv_grab_nz contained in its
	  hash of conditional stuff.  This should fix the bug where
	  Makefile.PL doesn't run if you say 'no' to tv_grab_nz.

2003-05-22 14:02  epaepa

	* grab/nl/tv_grab_nl: A further refinement to the

	  the clump, it was taken from the first programme but we have no
	  indication that this time applies to the clump as a whole (it

2003-05-17 11:48  epaepa

	* grab/nl/tv_grab_nl: Fixed recently-introduced timezone bug.
	  Added some more trace messages.

	  OK, with this commit I think the bug/feature reported by Johan
	  Schravesande is fixed.  Instead of giving up when confronted with
	  missing or nonsensical times, the grabber will try to output the
	  programmes as part of a clump.

2003-05-15 15:06  epaepa

	* Makefile.PL: Moved %share_files to the top level and let it be
	  altered by optional things.

2003-05-15 14:56  epaepa

	* Makefile.PL: Refactoring WriterMakefile()'s PL_FILES argument
	  into a variable %pl_files which can be added to by individual
	  optional things.

2003-05-15 14:26  epaepa

	* filter/tv_grep.in, grab/Grab_XML.pm, grab/na/tv_grab_na,
	  grab/sn/tv_grab_sn, lib/TZ.pm: Another attempt at fixing the
	  tv_grep timezone bug.  A new routine
	  XMLTV::TZ::parse_local_date() parses a date and converts it to
	  UTC, so that when Date_Init('TZ=UTC') is called the date object
	  does not get changed.

2003-05-14 22:24  rmeden

	* lib/exe_wrap.pl: limit output of Carp::Confess (called by
	  Date::Manip)

2003-05-14 17:02  epaepa

	* lib/XMLTV.pm.in: Go one better - bad programme or channel
	  elements are not returned to the caller at all.

2003-05-14 16:57  epaepa

	* lib/XMLTV.pm.in: Ignore <programme> elements missing required
	  attributes (return them as undef rather than a hash).

2003-05-13 16:39  epaepa

	* Makefile.PL: Date::Manip 5.41 is required, earlier versions have
	  a bug with numbered (rather than named) timezones.

2003-05-13 16:05  epaepa

	* t/data/: sort.xml, tv_cat_all_UTF8.expected,
	  tv_cat_sort_xml.expected, tv_extractinfo_en_all_UTF8.expected,
	  tv_extractinfo_en_sort_xml.expected, tv_grep_a_all_UTF8.expected,
	  tv_grep_a_sort_xml.expected,
	  tv_grep_on_after_2002_02_05_all_UTF8.expected,
	  tv_grep_on_after_2002_02_05_sort_xml.expected,
	  tv_grep_on_after_200302161330_all_UTF8.expected,
	  tv_grep_on_after_200302161330_sort_xml.expected,
	  tv_sort_all_UTF8.expected, tv_sort_by_channel_all_UTF8.expected,
	  tv_sort_by_channel_sort_xml.expected, tv_sort_sort_xml.expected,
	  tv_to_latex_all_UTF8.expected, tv_to_latex_sort_xml.expected,
	  tv_to_text_all_UTF8.expected, tv_to_text_sort_xml.expected: Added
	  test case for Date::Manip bug (fixed in 5.41).

2003-05-13 00:06  rmeden

	* lib/exe_wrap.pl: oops.. forgot File::Basename

2003-05-12 23:40  rmeden

	* choose/tv_check/README.tv_check: minor doc update

2003-05-12 23:36  rmeden

	* choose/tv_check/tv_check: adding a newline to improve error
	  display

2003-05-12 23:35  rmeden

	* lib/exe_wrap.pl: Pretty much a total rewrite.

	  On my development box (and hence the resulting EXEs) application
	  DIE messages were not being delivered to the users.

	  This version is much simpler (no self generating code), uses a
	  "require" instead of a "do" and seems to work fine.  Error
	  statuses are even passed as DOS ERRORLEVELS if you case to script
	  it.

2003-05-12 15:42  epaepa

	* grab/uk_rt/tv_grab_uk_rt.in: Fixed last fix.

2003-05-12 15:32  epaepa

	* grab/nl_wolf/tv_grab_nl_wolf: Added sanity check of index page.

2003-05-12 15:23  epaepa

	* filter/tv_grep.in, grab/Grab_XML.pm, grab/na/tv_grab_na,
	  grab/nl/tv_grab_nl, grab/sn/tv_grab_sn, grab/uk/tv_grab_uk.in,
	  grab/uk_rt/tv_grab_uk_rt.in: Attempting to fix bug with parsing
	  'now' or 'today' dates.  This can't be done after calling
	  Date_Init('TZ=UTC').

2003-05-12 15:15  epaepa

	* grab/nl/tv_grab_nl: Fixed --offset handling.

2003-05-12 13:51  epaepa

	* todo/xmltv-0.6.dtd: Whoops - forgot to add a place where <length>
	  can appear.

2003-05-12 12:47  epaepa

	* todo/TASKS.epa: Reinstated some thoughts about production vs
	  release date, they document which is which :-P.

2003-05-11 15:30  epaepa

	* Makefile.PL: Whoops, cut-n-paste error.

2003-05-11 15:24  epaepa

	* MANIFEST, Makefile.PL, grab/dk/tv_grab_dk: Adding Jesper Skov's
	  tv_grab_dk grabber for Denmark.

2003-05-11 11:14  epaepa

	* todo/xmltv-0.6.dtd: Ben Bucksch pointed out that having <host> as
	  well as <presenter> is somewhat redundant.

2003-05-11 10:34  epaepa

	* todo/TASKS.epa: In fact, the whole config file reading and
	  setting should be factored out.

2003-05-11 10:29  epaepa

	* todo/TASKS.epa: Perhaps the other grabbers should have some
	  mechanism like tv_grab_na for versioning config files.

2003-05-11 10:13  epaepa

	* todo/xmltv-0.6.dtd: Reinstated <episode-part> because some
	  listings sources need it.

2003-05-11 10:08  epaepa

	* todo/xmltv-0.6.dtd: Changed date format to follow XML Schema as
	  suggested by some on xmltv-devel.

2003-05-11 05:25  epaepa

	* MANIFEST, Makefile.PL, grab/hu/tv_grab_hu: New grabber:
	  tv_grab_hu for Hungary written by Attila Szekeres and Zsolt Varga
	  (although I have changed bits myself as well).

2003-05-11 05:22  epaepa

	* grab/: es/tv_grab_es, sn/tv_grab_sn: Don't read the config file
	  twice, use @config_lines which was read early on.

2003-05-11 04:29  epaepa

	* lib/XMLTV.pm.in: XMLTV::Writer now overrides dataElement() to
	  catch all cases of writing empty (or all-whitespace) element
	  content.  (For things which are intended to be empty call
	  emptyTag().)

2003-05-11 03:56  epaepa

	* todo/xmltv-0.6.dtd: Added 'original' flag to <title> as requested
	  by Ben Bucksch.

2003-05-11 02:56  epaepa

	* todo/xmltv-0.6.dtd: Suggested what 'type' to use for descriptions
	  of one-off programmes like films.

2003-05-11 02:47  epaepa

	* todo/xmltv-0.6.dtd: Provided some way to indicate the system used
	  for polyphonic audio, as requested by Ben Bucksch.

2003-05-11 02:33  epaepa

	* todo/xmltv-0.6.dtd: Some changes suggested by Ben Bucksch:
	  Changed source-info and generator-info back to elements
	  containing <link>.  Given an example of 'if-necessary' in an
	  attempt to explain it better.  Added 'encryption="none"' which is
	  an exception to the rule that values are application-defined.
	  Reinstated <length> although now it is only in seconds.

2003-05-11 02:07  epaepa

	* todo/xmltv-0.6.dtd: As suggested by Jeff Dairiki, removing
	  xml:lang from people's names, it is just too confusing.

2003-05-10 10:02  epaepa

	* grab/Mode.pm: Forgot to add and commit this file earlier.

2003-05-10 09:14  epaepa

	* MANIFEST, Makefile.PL, grab/es/tv_grab_es, grab/fi/tv_grab_fi,
	  grab/nl/tv_grab_nl, grab/sn/tv_grab_sn, grab/uk/tv_grab_uk.in,
	  grab/uk_rt/tv_grab_uk_rt.in: A new library XMLTV::Mode factors
	  out the check 'you cannot configure and list channels at the same
	  time'.

	  Made sure all the grabbers fail early if they cannot read the
	  config file during grabbing, rather than starting to download or
	  write data before the config file is checked.

2003-05-10 09:11  epaepa

	* grab/uk/: channel_ids, channel_pkgs/film: Removed a couple of
	  dead channels.

2003-05-10 09:10  epaepa

	* todo/TASKS.epa: There needs to be a summary 'xmltv' manpage and
	  an automated test suite for grabbers.

2003-05-10 08:48  epaepa

	* grab/nz/tv_grab_nz: Whoops, botched the last change - there was
	  already a config file message.  But it wasn't displayed until
	  later in the process.

2003-05-10 08:44  epaepa

	* grab/nz/tv_grab_nz: Print a message to stderr saying what config
	  filename has been guessed.

2003-05-10 07:23  epaepa

	* grab/es/tv_grab_es: Fixed spelling of --list-channels in
	  documentation.

2003-05-10 07:11  epaepa

	* todo/xmltv-0.6.dtd: Some more suggestsions from Christoph Paeper.
	  Changed to use xml:lang instead of plain lang, and this
	  attribute can be set in <tv> or <programme> and inherited by
	  child elements.  The four properties repeat, premiere, new-show
	  and last-chance are now mutually exclusive values of a single
	  'newness' attribute.	<audio> now has an 'extra-for-blind' flag
	  for audio tracks giving extra information.

2003-05-09 15:15  epaepa

	* MANIFEST, Makefile.PL, README, doc/QuickStart, doc/README.win32,
	  grab/us_gist/tv_grab_us_gist: Removed tv_grab_us_gist, the
	  gist.com site is no longer providing listings.

	  Removed the 'changes in this release' from README and
	  README.win32.

2003-05-09 14:58  epaepa

	* MANIFEST: Added grab/Get_nice.pm to file list.

2003-05-09 12:14  epaepa

	* todo/xmltv-0.6.dtd: One more example value for 'code-num'.

2003-05-08 17:26  rmeden

	* lib/exe_wrap.pl: removed error for tv_imdb.  It works on windows
	  now.

2003-05-08 17:23  rmeden

	* choose/tv_check/tv_check: rename $MYREPLAY_SAVE ->
	  $MYREPLAY_DEBUG more accurate added debug messages when
	  $MYREPLAY_DEBUG==2 shorten the "Mon, Tue, Wed...." to "*" in
	  warning if all days specified filter out episodes more than a
	  week away in extra eposide scan fix bug where day not set on
	  initial myrelaytv import

2003-05-08 14:25  epaepa

	* todo/xmltv-0.6.dtd: Jeff Dairiki pointed out that it wasn't clear
	  how to spell VideoPlus+(tm) in the 'system' attribute.

2003-05-08 14:20  epaepa

	* todo/xmltv-0.6.dtd: The <p> element is for paragraph text content
	  (Ben Bucksch found a listings source that needs it).

	  Fixed <star-rating> so it contains an <icon> rather than having
	  some unfinished IDREF to an icon stored elsewhere (thanks to Jeff
	  Dairiki for spotting this).  Also this means the textual content
	  has moved into its own <for> element, which seems tidier.

2003-05-06 09:41  jveldhuis

	* filter/tv_imdb: optimized a bit and now open/close database only
	  once instead of for every query

2003-05-06 09:41  jveldhuis

	* lib/IMDB.pm: removed come commented out code

2003-05-06 09:40  jveldhuis

	* lib/IMDB.pm: optimized a bit and now open/close database
	  index/deails files only once

2003-05-06 09:17  jveldhuis

	* lib/IMDB.pm: no longer dependent on look(1), now uses
	  Search::Dict

2003-05-06 09:16  jveldhuis

	* filter/tv_imdb: no longer dependent on look(1)

2003-05-05 10:54  jveldhuis

	* grab/na/ZapListings.pm: added in check of http status code when
	  first page is retrieved and warns http_proxy env variable may
	  need setting

2003-05-04 15:05  ramonroca

	* grab/es/tv_grab_es: Fixed a bug when the listing has not
	  description and now parses the title-subtitle

2003-05-04 13:14  epaepa

	* todo/xmltv-0.6.dtd: Added a vague <affiliation> element.

2003-05-04 13:10  epaepa

	* todo/xmltv-0.6.dtd: Added a FIXME.

2003-05-04 12:35  epaepa

	* todo/xmltv-0.6.dtd: Added optional <call-sign> element under
	  <channel>.  It could have been an attribute, but this way is more
	  consistent with <number>.

2003-05-04 12:29  epaepa

	* todo/xmltv-0.6.dtd: A couple of changes after discussion with Ben
	  Bucksch: <star-rating> can appear several times and element
	  content gives the type of star-rating; and a comment documents
	  the 'show' and 'season' terminology.

2003-05-04 12:13  epaepa

	* grab/sn/tv_grab_sn: Changed to use XMLTV::Get_nice so there is a
	  small delay between page fetches.

2003-05-04 12:09  epaepa

	* grab/Get_nice.pm: Whoops, I removed LWP::Simple from grabbers but
	  forgot to add it to Get_nice.pm.

2003-05-04 06:38  epaepa

	* Makefile.PL, grab/Get_nice.pm, grab/es/tv_grab_es,
	  grab/fi/tv_grab_fi, grab/it/tv_grab_it.in, grab/nl/tv_grab_nl,
	  grab/sn/tv_grab_sn: Factored out the code to get a page and then
	  sleep() into a new library XMLTV::Get_nice.

2003-05-04 05:32  epaepa

	* Makefile.PL: MY::manifypods(): small refactoring.

2003-05-04 05:27  epaepa

	* todo/xmltv-0.6.dtd: Clarified the usage of <unknown> with some
	  more comments and the attributes 'from' and 'until' in <tv>,
	  outside which things are implicitly unknown.

2003-05-04 04:44  epaepa

	* todo/xmltv-0.6.dtd: Fixed some comments following suggestions by
	  Ben Bucksch.

2003-05-03 15:14  jveldhuis

	* grab/na/tv_grab_na: fixed problem in configure when picking a
	  provider description that appears twice - SF Bug #731721

2003-05-03 07:56  epaepa

	* todo/TASKS.epa: Another todo.

2003-05-03 07:17  epaepa

	* todo/xmltv-0.6.dtd: Moved 'part' stuff out of episode-details, as
	  suggested by Davide Chiarini.

2003-05-03 05:58  epaepa

	* todo/xmltv-0.6.dtd: Added 'types' of <desc>, following discussion
	  on xmltv-devel.

2003-04-30 15:32  epaepa

	* todo/xmltv-0.6.dtd: Added FIXME.

2003-04-30 15:07  epaepa

	* todo/xmltv-0.6.dtd: Change to categories as discussed on
	  xmltv-devel: they can have both a code and a human-readable
	  description.	This means a single <category> element.

	  Fixed the example XML and documentation for the series -> season
	  name change.	Cleaned up a stray '>' character.

2003-04-29 13:25  epaepa

	* todo/xmltv-0.6.dtd: Documented more clearly that PDC times (for
	  example) are often in local timezone and so differ from the
	  physical times which are in UTC.  (Thanks to Andrew Wiseman for
	  clearing this up.)

2003-04-29 13:22  epaepa

	* todo/xmltv-0.6.dtd: Fixed some things suggested by Christoph
	  Paeper in discussion on xmltv-devel.

2003-04-28 09:28  jveldhuis

	* grab/na/tv_grab_na: config file major version 3 implemented  -
	  '#channel %d' entries are now 'not channel %d'  - 'provider %d #
	  %s' are now 'provider %d %s'

	  auto upgrading is done on the fly by identifying version 2 style
	  config files, warning to re-run --configure stage.

2003-04-27 12:19  epaepa

	* todo/: TASKS.epa, xmltv-0.6.dtd: First attempt at the new version
	  of the DTD.  I will send a message to the mailing list shortly.

2003-04-26 15:28  epaepa

	* Makefile.PL, README, doc/README.win32, lib/XMLTV.pm.in: Version
	  0.5.10.

2003-04-26 14:38  epaepa

	* grab/Memoize.pm: Handle Memoize versions that are not numeric.
	  (I don't think there have been any, it's just my local
	  hacked-around copy, but on principle...)

2003-04-26 14:37  epaepa

	* grab/Europe_TZ.pm: Changed a few input-validation errors to
	  Carp::croak() rather than die().

2003-04-26 14:31  epaepa

	* grab/fi/tv_grab_fi: Fixed timezone handling to use Europe_TZ.

2003-04-26 13:10  epaepa

	* grab/it/tv_grab_it.in: The bug 'I haven't even considered what
	  happens with DST issues' no longer exists!

2003-04-26 13:06  epaepa

	* grab/nz/tv_grab_nz: Removed redundant 'timezone' variable.  But
	  I'm still not sure what the code is doing with timezones... I
	  think it just ignores them.

2003-04-26 12:57  epaepa

	* grab/nl/tv_grab_nl: Fixed to use Europe_TZ for dates so the
	  timezone is correct in output.

	  Handle 'Behaalde prijzen' in programme descriptions.

2003-04-26 10:26  epaepa

	* grab/it/tv_grab_it.in: xmltv_date(): fixed to use Europe_TZ so
	  that the timezone switches correctly between +0100 and +0200.

2003-04-26 10:18  epaepa

	* grab/it/tv_grab_it.in: Stylistic change to remove unneeded
	  quotation marks around hash keys - this makes it easier to grep
	  through the code for {start}, for example.  Also removed some
	  trailing whitespace.

2003-04-26 08:00  epaepa

	* grab/fi/tv_grab_fi: If a stop time is not known, then no stop
	  time is written - this is better than guessing a wrong time.

2003-04-26 07:56  epaepa

	* grab/es/tv_grab_es: Removed incorrect comment - in fact the
	  grabber does not set top times at all.

2003-04-26 07:53  epaepa

	* grab/es/tv_grab_es: Fixed timezone handling, now uses
	  Europe_TZ.pm.  This gives the correct output now (summer time,
	  +0200) and hopefully will keep working after the change back to
	  CET.

2003-04-26 07:24  epaepa

	* grab/us_gist/tv_grab_us_gist: Corrected manual page.

2003-04-26 07:20  epaepa

	* grab/Memoize.pm: Realized that Getopt::Long has a 'passthrough'
	  option, so I don't need to write my own argument-parsing code
	  just to extract the --cache option.  We use the OO interface to
	  Getopt::Long to avoid setting global options which would affect
	  other callers.

2003-04-26 06:59  epaepa

	* grab/us_gist/tv_grab_us_gist: Implemented --configure to set
	  userid and timezone.	This replaces the environment variables
	  that were formerly used.

2003-04-26 06:12  epaepa

	* grab/us_gist/tv_grab_us_gist: Moved 'use LWP::UserAgent' to a
	  more logical place.

2003-04-26 06:01  epaepa

	* grab/us_gist/tv_grab_us_gist: Changed to use new cachables()
	  method to do memoization.  I still can't seem to memoize a method
	  rather than a function, so the work of getting pages has moved to
	  a new get_deflate() routine in the main package, which can then
	  be memoized.

2003-04-26 05:45  epaepa

	* grab/Grab_XML.pm: Instead of calling XMLTV::Memoize::check_argv()
	  with a fixed list of functions at the top of the script, call it
	  inside the go() method and get the list of things to memoize from
	  a new method cachables().  Then subclasses which have their own
	  way of fetching web pages can override that method.

2003-04-26 05:42  epaepa

	* grab/Memoize.pm: Whoops, forgot to turn of trace mesages.

2003-04-26 05:40  epaepa

	* grab/Memoize.pm: Fixed to work with names of functions not in the
	  caller's package (eg, calling check_argv('LWP::Simple::get')).
	  Now returns a reference to a list of memoized functions, or undef
	  if no memoization happens (this is consistent with the earlier
	  true/false return values).  Checks that memoize() succeeds and
	  dies if not.

2003-04-26 04:18  epaepa

	* grab/: Config_file.pm, es/tv_grab_es, fi/tv_grab_fi,
	  it/tv_grab_it.in, na/tv_grab_na, nl/tv_grab_nl, sn/tv_grab_sn,
	  uk/tv_grab_uk.in, uk_rt/tv_grab_uk_rt.in:
	  XMLTV::Config_file::filename(): print a message to stderr saying
	  what filename has been picked for the config file.  A new
	  optional 'quiet' argument turns this off.

	  Factored out the code for reading a config file as lines and
	  removing comments: a new routine
	  XMLTV::Config_file::read_lines().

2003-04-26 02:48  epaepa

	* grab/na/tv_grab_na: Changed s/\n$// to chomp, which is a Perl
	  builtin to do the same thing.

2003-04-26 02:08  epaepa

	* grab/: Config_file.pm, es/tv_grab_es, fi/tv_grab_fi,
	  it/tv_grab_it.in, nl/tv_grab_nl, nz/tv_grab_nz, sn/tv_grab_sn,
	  uk/tv_grab_uk.in, uk_rt/tv_grab_uk_rt.in: A new routine
	  XMLTV::Config_file::check_no_overwrite() factors out the
	  duplicated 'are you sure you want to overwrite the config file?'
	  check in most grabbers.

2003-04-25 15:19  epaepa

	* grab/us_gist/tv_grab_us_gist: Use XMLTV::Memoize to --cache the
	  get() method, since it is overridden in this class and doesn't
	  call LWP::Simple::get().

2003-04-25 15:17  epaepa

	* grab/Grab_XML.pm: Changed the undocumented --cache option to
	  cache LWP::Simple::get() rather than the method Grab_XML->get().

2003-04-25 14:18  epaepa

	* grab/nl/tv_grab_nl: Rateher than initializing Date::Manip to work
	  with Dutch date strings, keep it in English and change the
	  strings before passing them to ParseDate().  This is because the
	  language is a single global setting and we want to interoperate
	  with libraries that use English strings.

2003-04-25 13:26  epaepa

	* grab/sn/tv_grab_sn: Added a check that programme title is set
	  before attempting to call write_programme().	This may put us a
	  little closer to finding the cause of the problem Tommy Killander
	  reported on xmltv-users.

2003-04-24 17:01  staffanmalmgren

	* grab/sn/tv_grab_sn: Updated to use utc_offset to add UTC offset

	* grab/Europe_TZ.pm: Added convenience function utc_offset

2003-04-23 13:31  epaepa

	* todo/TASKS.epa: Gathered some information from the xmltv-devel
	  archives; collected together a bunch of requirements for
	  subtitles.

2003-04-23 13:23  epaepa

	* Makefile.PL, README: Promoted Memoize from 'recommended' to
	  'required', since perl 5.8 includes it.  Yes, you can always
	  scrape by without Memoize, but the user may not understand why
	  things are running slowly.  I could print a warning, but simpler
	  just to require the modulee, as more and more vendors ship 5.8 or
	  later.  VS:

2003-04-22 16:22  rmeden

	* grab/us_gist/tv_grab_us_gist: a few simple changes to allow
	  tv_grab_us_gist to be used with xmltv.exe The userid is no longer
	  hard coded, but set with an enviornment variable.  A TZ
	  adjustment is sent to GIST in the URL.

2003-04-22 14:22  staffanmalmgren

	* grab/sn/tv_grab_sn: Fixed bug which made timestamps have the
	  wrong timezone due to DST changeover, for good (hopefully)

2003-04-22 13:32  epaepa

	* grab/Europe_TZ.pm: date_to_eur(): Fixed (I hope) to work with
	  timeonzes other than UTC/UTC+1.  Thanks to Staffan M. for finding
	  the bug,

2003-04-22 08:07  ramonroca

	* grab/es/tv_grab_es: Another break at elpais.es, seems active
	  those days

2003-04-20 18:57  rmeden

	* choose/tv_check/tv_check: don't use Replay fuzzy logic for
	  MYREPLAYTV devices because the episode will be added as a
	  separate show by the MYREPLAYTV fetch logic.

	  Removed extra fields from SHOW file.

2003-04-20 14:40  epaepa

	* MANIFEST, Makefile.PL, grab/Config_file.pm, grab/es/tv_grab_es,
	  grab/fi/tv_grab_fi, grab/it/tv_grab_it.in, grab/na/tv_grab_na,
	  grab/nl/tv_grab_nl, grab/nz/tv_grab_nz, grab/sn/tv_grab_sn,
	  grab/uk/tv_grab_uk.in, grab/uk_rt/tv_grab_uk_rt.in: A new library
	  XMLTV::Config_file encapsulates the job of working out the config
	  filename and doing weird things like creating directories or
	  migrating config filenames.

2003-04-20 06:26  epaepa

	* MANIFEST, Makefile.PL, grab/Europe_TZ.pm, grab/uk/tv_grab_uk.in,
	  grab/uk_rt/tv_grab_uk_rt.in, lib/TZ.pm, lib/UK_TZ.pm: Replaced
	  the UK_TZ.pm library with Europe_TZ.pm, which should work for
	  most European countries.  The functions are the same but you must
	  pass in the 'base' or winter timezone as an extra parameter (so
	  for British times pass 'UTC').

	  TZ.pm has a new routine tz_to_num() which converts named
	  timezones to their numeric equivalent.

2003-04-20 05:57  epaepa

	* grab/sn/tv_grab_sn: Whitespace.

2003-04-20 04:07  ramonroca

	* grab/es/tv_grab_es: Solved a break due to change in elpais.es,
	  and othe minor things

2003-04-20 02:33  epaepa

	* todo/TASKS.epa: Anotehr todo item.

2003-04-19 09:10  allena28

	* grab/uk/channel_pkgs/NTL/: analogue, digital/Base: Updates to NTL
	  Packages

2003-04-18 10:12  allena28

	* grab/uk/channel_pkgs/Sky/: Family, Value: updated Sky packages

2003-04-18 08:44  epaepa

	* grab/uk/README: Removed UK_TZ.pm from the file descriptions since
	  it no longer lives in this directory.

2003-04-18 08:24  epaepa

	* lib/exe_wrap.pl: Each 'command' subroutine stored in %cmds is now
	  expected to handle errors itself - to exit(1) or die() if things
	  went wrong.  This means that the commands for do()ing some Perl
	  script need to check the return value of do() and the $! and $@
	  variables.  Then if a command returns control to the caller, we
	  just exit successfully.

	  This should fix the bug reported by Andy Balaam on xmltv-devel,
	  'non-zero exit codes in Windows'.  But it is *untested*, I don't
	  have access to the Windows exe compiler.

2003-04-18 07:54  epaepa

	* grab/nl/tv_grab_nl: Added function prototypes.

	  get_courteous(): there seems to be a difference in Perl versions
	  on how calling get_courteous_aux(@_) is interpreted.	Or some
	  weird interaction with Memoize.  It seems that @_ was being
	  turned into a scalar by taking the length of the list, ie 1.
	  I've changed it to call get_courteous_aux($_[0]), which works on
	  perl 5.8 and should work on all other versions.

2003-04-16 07:15  rmeden

	* lib/exe_wrap.pl: removed CST6CDT style filenames. Replaced with
	  numeric style.  (The above was required due to a big in
	  Parse::Date, which has been fixed)

	  Added a module to block tv_imdb, since it requires a unix "look"
	  program.

2003-04-16 07:09  rmeden

	* choose/tv_check/tv_check: don't alarm on unexpected show length
	  if length missing or zero.  fixed problem with "NO GUIDE"
	  messages if last entry of the day

2003-04-15 14:02  epaepa

	* filter/tv_cat, lib/XMLTV.pm.in: Moved catfiles() from tv_cat into
	  XMLTV.pm.

2003-04-15 13:46  epaepa

	* filter/tv_cat: catfiles(): Refactored the code into this routine,
	  which is passed some arguments for an XMLTV::Writer and some
	  filenames to read from.  Intending to move into XMLTV.pm soon.

2003-04-14 08:54  jveldhuis

	* grab/na/: ZapListings.pm, tv_grab_na: switched cases were I use
	  [^\s]+ in regexp with \S+

2003-04-13 02:46  epaepa

	* grab/us_gist/tv_grab_us_gist: Link to Gist's page describing
	  their XMLTV feed.

2003-04-12 15:04  epaepa

	* grab/us_gist/tv_grab_us_gist: Override XMLTV::Grab_XML::get() to
	  add 'Accept-encoding: gzip' and then decompress.  The grabber now
	  works!

2003-04-12 14:40  epaepa

	* grab/: Grab_XML.pm, de/tv_grab_de, nl_wolf/tv_grab_nl_wolf,
	  us_gist/tv_grab_us_gist: XMLTV::Grab_XML::get(): new package
	  method to get the contents of a page at a given URL.	This will
	  let grabbers override the mechanism used to fetch a page (the
	  default implementation uses LWP::Simple).

	  This does mean that packages inheriting from XMLTV::Grab_XML
	  should not import LWP::Simple's get() function, it will clash
	  with the method of the same name.

2003-04-12 05:45  epaepa

	* MANIFEST, Makefile.PL, doc/QuickStart,
	  grab/us_gist/tv_grab_us_gist: Adding a new grabber
	  tv_grab_us_gist to fetch the XMLTV listings made available by
	  gist.com.  It's not yet finished and in fact I don't even know if
	  it works - but it will soon.	(Committing so I can run it from my
	  shell account rather than over a modem link!)

2003-04-12 03:42  epaepa

	* todo/TASKS.epa: Added an extract from my recent message on
	  xmltv-devel about <category>.

2003-04-09 21:55  jveldhuis

	* lib/IMDB.pm: make argument naming consistant with tv_imdb

2003-04-09 21:53  jveldhuis

	* filter/: tv_imdb: --moviesOnly is no --movies-only

2003-04-06 15:27  jveldhuis

	* filter/tv_imdb, lib/IMDB.pm: added --moviesOnly option

2003-04-06 14:40  jveldhuis

	* lib/IMDB.pm: Term::ProgressBar now optional - thanks to Ed for
	  the patch

2003-04-06 14:34  jveldhuis

	* lib/IMDB.pm: removed a duplicated conditional

2003-04-06 11:20  epaepa

	* MANIFEST, Makefile.PL, grab/nl_wolf/tv_grab_nl_wolf: New grabber:
	  tv_grab_nl_wolf downloads XMLTV files from Carlo de Wolf's site.
	  Is is based on the Grab_XML library recently factored out of
	  tv_grab_de.

2003-04-06 11:17  epaepa

	* mkdist: Comment.

2003-04-06 10:59  epaepa

	* lib/XMLTV.pm.in: cat(): when several sets of listings have
	  different 'dates', choose the latest date for the result.  Other
	  attributes of <tv> are processed as before (taken arbitrarily
	  from the first file).

2003-04-06 10:29  epaepa

	* mkdist: chdir() to $TMP_CHECKOUT_DIR once rather than prepending
	  a 'cd' to every command run.

	  Don't use tar --bzip2, it pads the compressed data with zeros or
	  something weird.

2003-04-06 10:22  epaepa

	* mkdist: FTP the tarball in binary mode!

2003-04-06 08:55  epaepa

	* MANIFEST, Makefile.PL, grab/Grab_XML.pm, grab/de/tv_grab_de,
	  lib/Usage.pm: Factored out most code from tv_grab_de into a new
	  library XMLTV::Grab_XML.  Changed XMLTV::Usage so you can pass a
	  usage message to usage(), you don't have to set it when importing
	  the module.  Fixed a Makefile bug where manual pages would be
	  installed under the wrong filename.

2003-04-06 04:36  epaepa

	* Makefile.PL: Version 0.5.9.

2003-04-06 04:31  epaepa

	* doc/README.win32: Updated with changes for the new release
	  (assuming that tv_imdb and the new grabbers will be included in
	  xmltv.exe).

2003-04-06 04:28  epaepa

	* doc/README.win32: Version 0.5.9 (although the Windows binary
	  won't come out immediately).

2003-04-06 04:26  epaepa

	* lib/XMLTV.pm.in: Version 0.5.9.

2003-04-06 03:58  epaepa

	* README: Updated for 0.5.9.

2003-04-06 03:39  epaepa

	* grab/de/tv_grab_de: Documented the fact that the upstream
	  listings currently have broken timezones.

2003-04-06 03:24  epaepa

	* doc/QuickStart: Added a paragraph about tv_imdb.

2003-04-05 14:40  epaepa

	* todo/TASKS.epa: A couple of things to add to the file format.

2003-04-05 14:39  epaepa

	* grab/uk/: channel_ids, channel_pkgs/classics, channel_pkgs/film,
	  channel_pkgs/Sky/Family, channel_pkgs/Telewest/Supreme: Removed
	  some channels which were no longer on the site.

2003-04-05 14:29  epaepa

	* grab/nz/tv_grab_nz: Documented a bug.

2003-04-05 14:05  epaepa

	* grab/nl/tv_grab_nl: Don't output 'debug_more' comments in fast
	  mode (this was left in the code by mistake).

2003-04-05 14:05  epaepa

	* grab/nl/tv_grab_nl: Added support for 'Orginele Titel' in
	  programme description pages.

2003-04-05 13:52  epaepa

	* grab/nl/tv_grab_nl: Fixed several bugs including missing
	  programmes when a day is split over two pages ('Volgende' link,
	  which previously was not handled by --slow mode).  This has
	  involved commonizing some of the code between fast and slow,
	  which is no bad thing.

2003-04-05 11:50  epaepa

	* lib/XMLTV.pm.in: Fixed the handling of 'debug' keys in hases so
	  it does what it says on the tin.  It should work now for channels
	  as well as programmes.

2003-04-05 11:26  epaepa

	* lib/XMLTV.pm.PL: Don't 'use diagnostics', they slow down loading
	  and aren't that helpful.

2003-04-05 04:18  epaepa

	* grab/nl/tv_grab_nl: do_summary_page(): handle (recursively) the
	  'Volgende' links that sometimes appear.  These mean next page for
	  the same day.  This has involved adding a new parameter,
	  'official day' which is not necessarily the same as 'actual day',
	  and is used only to sanity-check the date printed in the page.

2003-04-05 02:08  epaepa

	* grab/nz/tv_grab_nz: Removed debugging message left in the code my
	  mistake.

2003-04-05 01:38  epaepa

	* grab/sn/tv_grab_sn: Added some missing function prototypes.

2003-04-05 01:32  epaepa

	* grab/sn/tv_grab_sn: Quote an apostrophe in pod documentation to
	  avoid confusing editors.

2003-04-04 14:57  epaepa

	* grab/nl/tv_grab_nl: Moved the code for downloading and processing
	  the programme summary page for each day into a routine
	  do_summary_page().

2003-04-04 14:39  epaepa

	* grab/nl/tv_grab_nl: Eliminated confusing $date variable.

2003-04-04 14:11  epaepa

	* grab/nz/tv_grab_nz: Fixed bug where a programme crossing midnight
	  would have a stop time in the wrong day.

2003-04-04 12:36  epaepa

	* grab/uk_rt/tv_grab_uk_rt.in: Handle URLs which appear in without
	  preceding text like 'Related Websites'.

2003-04-04 10:39  epaepa

	* grab/sn/tv_grab_sn: Patch from Martin Moeller to cope with a
	  recent site change.

2003-04-03 00:26  epaepa

	* grab/nl/tv_grab_nl: Fixed bug reported by Marcel where the first
	  programme after midnight on a given day would not have its stop
	  time moved forward by 24 hours - due to a 'my' in an inner scope
	  hiding the real $stop variable.

2003-04-03 00:23  epaepa

	* filter/tv_sort: Added a warnong for programmes whose stop time is
	  before their start time.

2003-04-02 12:32  epaepa

	* grab/nl/tv_grab_nl: Changed default number of days to seven.

2003-04-02 12:29  epaepa

	* grab/nl/tv_grab_nl: Fixed to work again with offset zero: I
	  didn't realize that (uniquely among the sites fetched from so
	  far) the listings source does number its days from zero.

	  Better handling of pages that have no listings content at all (as
	  when you ask for more days than the site has).

2003-03-31 12:20  epaepa

	* todo/TASKS.epa: A couple more file format improvements to be
	  done.

2003-03-31 00:21  epaepa

	* doc/QuickStart: Updated for newly added grabbers.

2003-03-30 18:20  jveldhuis

	* grab/na/tv_grab_na: when a command line error occurs or usage
	  problem, print message about how to get command line help,
	  instead of providing the help... windows users fail to see actual
	  error messages since usage is so long

2003-03-30 14:08  staffanmalmgren

	* grab/sn/tv_grab_sn: Changed maintaner information, as per Ed's
	  suggestion

2003-03-30 06:45  epaepa

	* grab/uk/tv_grab_uk.in: Better error message when --offset is
	  given and the site doesn't have enough days of listings to
	  satisfy the request (which is happening increasingly often).

2003-03-30 06:03  epaepa

	* grab/nl/tv_grab_nl: Fixed date calculation bug: the day numbers
	  on the site count from 1 meaning today.

2003-03-30 06:02  epaepa

	* grab/uk_rt/tv_grab_uk_rt.in: get_programmes(): prepend the URL to
	  warning and error messages.

2003-03-30 05:25  epaepa

	* grab/de/tv_grab_de: Accept but politely ignore the --config-file
	  option.

2003-03-30 05:22  epaepa

	* grab/nz/tv_grab_nz: Added support for a --cache option which is
	  ignored.  This is for consistency with the undocumented --cache
	  option in other grabbers: the option now means 'cache me if you
	  can'.

2003-03-30 05:14  epaepa

	* grab/nz/tv_grab_nz: More thorough command-line checking: error if
	  there are arguments left over after parsing options.

2003-03-30 04:43  epaepa

	* grab/na/tv_grab_na: Added an --cache option which is accepted but
	  ignored.  This is for consistency with the other grabbers, in
	  particular, to make it easier to write a grabber test suite.
	  Some day the --cache option can actually do something.

2003-03-30 04:37  epaepa

	* grab/na/tv_grab_na: Check the command line more throughly: it is
	  an error if any arguments remain after processing options.

2003-03-30 04:35  epaepa

	* grab/na/tv_grab_na: Improved main usage message.

2003-03-30 04:18  epaepa

	* grab/na/tv_grab_na: Made same tidying elsewhere, I didn't realize
	  there were two cals to GetOptions().

2003-03-30 02:37  epaepa

	* grab/na/tv_grab_na: Code tidy moving each command-line option
	  onto its own line.  This should make it easier to add and remove
	  them and change them in patches (since diff works line-by-line).

2003-03-29 16:14  epaepa

	* grab/nl/tv_grab_nl: Don't warn about 'Volgende' link which has
	  started appearing on channel summary pages.

2003-03-29 16:13  epaepa

	* grab/uk_rt/tv_grab_uk_rt.in: Suppress duplicate warnings when the
	  channel name of a programme details page doesn't match that on
	  the channels page (this has started firing for a difference
	  bwtween 'Sky 1' and 'Sky One').

2003-03-29 16:07  epaepa

	* grab/uk/: channel_ids, channel_pkgs/Freeview, channel_pkgs/wales:
	  Channel S4C2 seems to have disappeared from the site.  I'm just
	  commenting it out for now in case it reappears later.

2003-03-29 15:49  epaepa

	* grab/nl/tv_grab_nl: Was being a bit overzealous in delete()ing a
	  TreeBuilder object before the data from it had been extracted.

2003-03-29 14:17  epaepa

	* filter/tv_extractinfo_en: Don't memoize list_names().  My Memoize
	  seems to have gone funny recently, confusing scalar and list
	  context.

2003-03-29 13:53  epaepa

	* MANIFEST, Makefile.PL, grab/nl/tv_grab_nl: Added tv_grab_nl, a
	  grabber for the Netherlands.	This is based on the version Guido
	  Diepen sent me but I have rewritten parts of it - in particular,
	  the default mode is now to output only brief programme details
	  and save on page fetches.

2003-03-29 12:27  epaepa

	* todo/TASKS.epa: Another task that's partly done is the
	  --list-channels option.  I am adding it here because I've decided
	  that --list-channels is not a hard requirement for new grabbers
	  at the moment: I am adding new grabbers (or making new releases
	  of existing ones) that lack this option.

2003-03-29 10:21  epaepa

	* grab/sn/tv_grab_sn: Patch from Staffen Malmgren.  Here's his
	  description:

	  The following patch fixes three bugs concerning the --configure
	  mode of tv_grab_sn.

	  The first one is one i introduced myself in my patch from a
	  couple of months ago; the 'all' answer to "add channel FOO?"
	  question would incorrectly NOT add the current channel (but it
	  would add all following channels)

	  The second two were introduced in revisions 1.19, 1.20 or
	  thereabouts (and so does not seem to be present in 0.58). The
	  first error was handling a array reference as though it was
	  scalar (and thus ending up with a lot of "ARRAY(0xABCD1234)" in
	  the configuration questions and config file.	The second was a
	  regression in the HTML scraping of available channels -- along
	  with the valid channels, a bunch of categories would be returned.

	  The patch is tested with both Swedish and Norwegian channels.

2003-03-28 17:28  rmeden

	* doc/README.win32: add warning about using spaces in xmltv.exe
	  path

2003-03-28 12:49  epaepa

	* filter/tv_extractinfo_en, grab/de/tv_grab_de, grab/es/tv_grab_es,
	  grab/fi/tv_grab_fi, grab/it/tv_grab_it.in, grab/sn/tv_grab_sn,
	  grab/uk/tv_grab_uk.in: Benjamin Goldberg on
	  comp.lang.perl.moderated pointed out a better way to check if a
	  module is availabl, setting a compile-time constant rather than a
	  variable.  So the constant Have_bar replaces the variable
	  $have_bar.

2003-03-28 12:34  epaepa

	* filter/Grep.pm: Explicitly list the handlers which cannot be
	  queried on; die if a handler name is not recognized.	This makes
	  sure that when adding a new handler to XMLTV.pm we also decide
	  what should happen with it in XMLTV/Grep.pm.

2003-03-28 12:13  epaepa

	* MANIFEST: Added tv_grab_it to file list.

2003-03-27 14:55  epaepa

	* grab/uk/: channel_ids, channel_pkgs/Freeview, channel_pkgs/adult,
	  channel_pkgs/arts, channel_pkgs/children, channel_pkgs/comedy,
	  channel_pkgs/entertainment, channel_pkgs/factual,
	  channel_pkgs/gratis, channel_pkgs/lifestyle, channel_pkgs/music,
	  channel_pkgs/news, channel_pkgs/regional, channel_pkgs/sport,
	  channel_pkgs/travel, channel_pkgs/NTL/analogue,
	  channel_pkgs/NTL/digital/Base, channel_pkgs/NTL/digital/Family,
	  channel_pkgs/Sky/Family, channel_pkgs/Telewest/Entry,
	  channel_pkgs/Telewest/Essential, channel_pkgs/Telewest/Supreme:
	  Removed a lot of channels which seem to have disappeared from the
	  site.  Based on a patch sent in by Paul McDermott.

2003-03-27 03:01  rmeden

	* choose/tv_check/tv_check: added code to skip episodes without a
	  start time

2003-03-26 15:12  epaepa

	* grab/nz/tv_grab_nz: Added --config-file option.

	  Accept 'yes' answer to y/N question.

	  When reading the config file give an error if the 'channels' line
	  is not present or appears more than once.  Also don't default the
	  channels list if an I/O error occurs; just give an error.

2003-03-22 16:34  epaepa

	* grab/Memoize.pm: Memoize the function in list context as well as
	  scalar context - but using the same cache for both (the MERGE
	  option).

2003-03-20 06:13  jveldhuis

	* grab/na/tv_grab_na: now unlinks temperary file on write failure

2003-03-18 14:11  epaepa

	* todo/TASKS.epa: Another DTD requirement.

2003-03-17 11:44  allena28

	* grab/uk/channel_pkgs/NTL/digital/: Base, Disney, Family, Sports,
	  movies: Updates to NTL packages

2003-03-17 06:41  allena28

	* grab/uk/channel_pkgs/Telewest/: Entry, Essential, Essential_Plus,
	  Supreme: Updated telewest details in channel_pkgs for tv_grab_uk

	* lib/XMLTV.pm.in: When writing <episode-number>, if the 'system'
	  attribute is not given then default it to 'onscreen'.  This
	  agrees more with what the docs say (and avoids the current bug
	  where it could be written as an empty string if undef).

2003-03-15 08:21  epaepa

	* MANIFEST, Makefile.PL, grab/es/tv_grab_es: Adding Ramon Roca's
	  tv_grab_es grabber for Spain.

2003-03-15 04:19  epaepa

	* todo/TASKS.epa: Another file format idea.

2003-03-15 04:17  epaepa

	* filter/tv_grep.in: Dcoumentation clarification.

2003-03-15 04:03  epaepa

	* filter/tv_grep.in: Generalized the warning about not always using
	  the programme autgenerated tests.

2003-03-15 03:53  epaepa

	* filter/: tv_grep.PL, tv_grep.in: Get the manual page information
	  from the Grep.pm library.  This should make sure the manual page
	  stays in sync with changes to tv_grep (it was inconsistent
	  before).

2003-03-13 13:42  rmeden

	* choose/tv_check/README.tv_check: bring the quick-start guide up
	  to date with current version

2003-03-12 17:22  mnbjhguyt

	* grab/it/tv_grab_it.in: more messed up chars fixed

2003-03-12 16:16  epaepa

	* MANIFEST, Makefile.PL, filter/Grep.pm, filter/tv_grep.in: Moved
	  get_matcher() out of tv_grep into a new library Grep.pm.  This is
	  just so it can later be used in pod generation.

2003-03-12 15:18  epaepa

	* filter/tv_grep.in: Fixed a bug in get_handler() and in the use of
	  the same.  Added some trace messages.

2003-03-11 15:54  epaepa

	* filter/tv_grep.in: get_matcher(): new function to replace
	  %queryable hash.  Returns working subs rather than subs you must
	  call to get more subs.

2003-03-11 15:24  epaepa

	* filter/tv_grep.in: Moved the information of how to match on
	  different data types into the hash %queryable, which is used both
	  to look up matching subroutines and to generate the usage
	  message.  (It is a bit convoluted, with subs returning subs, but
	  that could be fixed later.)  Next I have to fix the manual page
	  generation, which is incorrect.

2003-03-11 10:22  jveldhuis

	* grab/na/tv_grab_na: properly sets new id if description changes,
	  minor changes to warning messages

2003-03-11 10:20  jveldhuis

	* grab/na/ZapListings.pm: better error message

2003-03-10 15:51  epaepa

	* Makefile.PL, README, doc/QuickStart, grab/it/dud_channels,
	  grab/it/tv_grab_it.PL, grab/it/tv_grab_it.in: New grabber
	  tv_grab_it contributed by Davide Chiarini.

2003-03-10 15:51  epaepa

	* grab/uk/tv_grab_uk.PL: Fixed invocation of set_share_dir.pl.

2003-03-10 15:50  epaepa

	* filter/tv_imdb: Escaped a quotation mark to avoid confusing
	  emacs.

2003-03-10 15:33  epaepa

	* lib/set_share_dir.pl: Oops, it didn't work, should now.

2003-03-10 15:27  epaepa

	* MANIFEST, lib/set_share_dir.pl, grab/uk/tv_grab_uk.PL:
	  Generalized tv_grab_uk.PL, which sets the $SHARE_DIR constant in
	  a source file, into the 'library' set_share_dir.pl.

2003-03-10 11:39  epaepa

	* Makefile.PL: Term::ProgressBar version 2 is recommended (tv_imdb
	  uses the new interface).

2003-03-10 11:34  epaepa

	* MANIFEST: Added tv_imdb files and new tv_grab_uk provider channel
	  packages to file list.

2003-03-09 23:59  jveldhuis

	* lib/IMDB.pm: minor adjustment to success/failure message

2003-03-09 23:55  jveldhuis

	* lib/IMDB.pm: adopted use of Term::ProgressBar, and lots of it.
	  better feedback on every part of each of the 5 stages.

	  also error messages for each stage appear in stageX.log files
	  instead of being lost to stderr. The number of error messages is
	  reported at the end of each stage's success or failure.

2003-03-09 10:23  epaepa

	* grab/fi/tv_grab_fi: Log the URL that's being fetched.

2003-03-09 09:55  jveldhuis

	* lib/IMDB.pm: added note to look at Term::ProgressBar

2003-03-09 07:52  epaepa

	* grab/fi/tv_grab_fi: Debugging trace messages.

2003-03-09 06:22  epaepa

	* grab/fi/tv_grab_fi: process_table(): now returns a list of
	  programme hashes to be written, rather than taking the
	  XMLTV::Writer as a parameter.

2003-03-09 06:15  epaepa

	* grab/fi/tv_grab_fi: make_programme_hash(): new name for
	  write_data(), it no longer writes but just returns a hash
	  suitable for XMLTV.pm.

2003-03-09 05:45  epaepa

	* grab/fi/tv_grab_fi: Whitespace.

2003-03-09 05:40  epaepa

	* grab/fi/tv_grab_fi: Fixed documentation of config filename.

2003-03-08 06:41  epaepa

	* xmltv.dtd: Clarified that we use DNS-like names for channels not
	  whole URIs.

2003-03-07 11:58  allena28

	* grab/uk/channel_pkgs/Freeview: Test updated to check CVS is
	  working

2003-03-05 16:56  epaepa

	* Makefile.PL: Install files for new tv_imdb filter.

2003-03-05 14:03  epaepa

	* Makefile.PL: Added warning for possibly-buggy perl versions.

2003-03-04 13:59  jveldhuis

	* lib/IMDB.pm: bugs in db_version:  - directors who did multiple
	  episodes of tv series appeared more than once.   - actresses
	  didn't appear in list of actors :) (thanks Chris L. and Bob Y.)

2003-03-04 11:44  jveldhuis

	* filter/tv_imdb: BUG:	How and what to look up needs to be option
	  driven.

2003-03-03 23:29  jveldhuis

	* filter/tv_imdb: perldoc fixes

2003-03-03 23:23  jveldhuis

	* filter/tv_imdb, lib/IMDB.pm: more major enhancements

2003-03-03 17:43  jveldhuis

	* doc/QuickStart: added tv_imdb

2003-03-03 17:41  jveldhuis

	* lib/IMDB.pm: fixed typo

2003-03-03 17:37  jveldhuis

	* filter/tv_imdb, lib/IMDB.pm: now looks up tv series in imdb.com
	  data added in-memory cache for tv series lookups

2003-03-03 15:58  jveldhuis

	* lib/IMDB.pm: minor fix

2003-03-03 15:57  jveldhuis

	* filter/tv_imdb: fixed typo

2003-03-03 14:19  jveldhuis

	* lib/IMDB.pm: now handles gzipped directors/actors and actresses
	  files

2003-03-03 08:40  jveldhuis

	* filter/tv_imdb: filter to augment listing data with imdb.com
	  plain text files

2003-03-03 08:39  jveldhuis

	* lib/IMDB.pm: first swing at indexing the imdb.com plain text
	  files

2003-03-01 06:13  epaepa

	* grab/sn/tv_grab_sn: extract_channel_data(): new routine holding
	  the HTML-munging code from get_channels().

2003-03-01 05:04  epaepa

	* grab/sn/tv_grab_sn: Added --list-channels option partly based on
	  a patch by Julian Cable.  It requires an additional option --loc
	  to choose channels for Sweden or Norway.

	  Currently the output from --list-channels gives different ids to
	  those in the normal listings, I will fix this soon.

2003-03-01 04:48  epaepa

	* grab/sn/tv_grab_sn: Moved the names of the two countries to
	  %COUNTRIES at the top of the file.

2003-03-01 04:40  epaepa

	* lib/XMLTV.pm.in: Debugging message.

2003-03-01 04:30  epaepa

	* xmltv.dtd: Added a note about ordering of <channel> elements.

2003-03-01 04:27  epaepa

	* grab/uk/tv_grab_uk.in: Write <channel> elements in sorted order.
	  The file format says that order of channels doesn't matter, but
	  it makes files easier to diff if you sort them.

2003-02-28 16:05  epaepa

	* grab/uk/tv_grab_uk.in: Corrected message; sadly, grabbing no
	  longer gets a whole week's listings.

2003-02-26 15:43  epaepa

	* grab/uk/channel_pkgs/NTL/digital/Base: Changed choice.bbc.co.uk
	  to bbc3.bbc.co.uk, I missed this one earlier.

2003-02-26 14:42  epaepa

	* Makefile.PL: Install tv_grab_uk's channel_pkgs, including those
	  in subdirectories.

2003-02-26 14:04  epaepa

	* grab/uk/channel_pkgs/NTL/digital/: Base, base: Renamed base to
	  Base since it is clearly the name of a subscription package (it
	  contains Sky One and other pay channels).

2003-02-26 14:02  epaepa

	* grab/uk/channel_pkgs/: Freeview, NTL/digital/Family,
	  NTL/digital/base, Telewest/Entry: Fixed some channel ids in
	  newly-added subscription packages; removed racingchannel.com;
	  removed packages from NTL/digital/Family that were already in
	  NTL/digital/base.

2003-02-26 13:47  epaepa

	* grab/uk/: channel_ids, channel_pkgs/arts, channel_pkgs/comedy,
	  channel_pkgs/entertainment, channel_pkgs/factual,
	  channel_pkgs/film, channel_pkgs/NTL/digital/Family,
	  channel_pkgs/Sky/Family, channel_pkgs/Telewest/Essential: The
	  site has removed the special 'telewest' and 'ntl' variants of
	  channels.

2003-02-26 13:30  epaepa

	* grab/uk/tv_grab_uk.in: Documentation and formatting changes.

2003-02-26 13:24  epaepa

	* MANIFEST: Removed directory from MANIFEST, it should list only
	  plain files.

2003-02-23 13:48  epaepa

	* grab/uk/: tv_grab_uk.in, channel_pkgs/Freeview,
	  channel_pkgs/NTL/analogue, channel_pkgs/NTL/digital/Disney,
	  channel_pkgs/NTL/digital/Family, channel_pkgs/NTL/digital/Sports,
	  channel_pkgs/NTL/digital/base, channel_pkgs/NTL/digital/movies,
	  channel_pkgs/Sky/Family, channel_pkgs/Sky/Movies_World,
	  channel_pkgs/Sky/Sports, channel_pkgs/Sky/Value,
	  channel_pkgs/Telewest/Entry, channel_pkgs/Telewest/Essential,
	  channel_pkgs/Telewest/Essential_Plus,
	  channel_pkgs/Telewest/Supreme: Added a bunch of new channel
	  packages from Adam Allen.  These correspond to the channel
	  lineups available from different TV providers.

	  Because the new packages naturally arrange themselves into a
	  directory structure, tv_grab_uk now uses File::Find to look for
	  all packages in its directory.  However I haven't yet worked out
	  how to modify the Makefile.PL to install the packages.

2003-02-23 10:25  epaepa

	* todo/TASKS.epa: Another suggestion from my inbox.

2003-02-23 10:19  epaepa

	* todo/TASKS.epa: The file format could specify both release date
	  (a la tv_grab_na) and production date (a la imdb).

2003-02-22 15:10  epaepa

	* grab/fi/tv_grab_fi: Added --list-channels mode partly based on
	  patch by Julian Cable.  Also tidied up some of the code.

2003-02-22 10:33  epaepa

	* todo/TASKS.epa: Maybe we could use the Module::Dist CPAN module
	  to build packages instead of (part of) the 'mkdist' script.

2003-02-21 16:58  epaepa

	* grab/na/tv_grab_na: Updated comment and usage message to say
	  --config-file not --config (thanks to rmeden for spotting).

2003-02-20 21:28  rmeden

	* choose/tv_check/tv_check: prevent warnings when we don't have a
	  stop time by using the start time.

2003-02-20 21:26  rmeden

	* lib/exe_wrap.pl: remove constants when computing timezone.. oops

	  broadcast (at least partly) at a given data.

2003-02-20 15:27  epaepa

	* lib/exe_wrap.pl: Even more obvious error message for people who

2003-02-20 15:20  epaepa

	* grab/uk/channel_pkgs/gratis: Noted the difference between two
	  kinds of 'free' channels.

2003-02-19 15:17  epaepa

	* grab/uk/channel_ids: Changed an XMLTV id from
	  'radio-5-mw.bbc.co.uk' to just 'radio-5.bbc.co.uk' because the
	  means of transmission shouldn't really be part of the id unless
	  there are two different stations broadcasting on different media.
	  Radio 5 broadcasts on medium wave only.

2003-02-19 15:11  epaepa

	* filter/tv_sort,
	  t/data/tv_sort_by_channel_test_sort_by_channel_xml.expected:
	  add_stop(): Rewrote using a simpler algorithm: go through all the
	  following programmes and pick the start time if it is later than
	  ours, or the stop time if it exists.	If neither condition is
	  true move on to the next following programme.

	  I don't know why I made it so complex to start with, I think it
	  was because I thought it sensible to start at the end of the
	  sorted list and work backwards.  And it would be sensible, if you
	  only looked at start times.  But we don't any more.

	  This should fix the pesky bug where tv_sort --by-channels doesn't
	  work because add_stop() would break the sortedness of its input
	  programmes list.

2003-02-19 09:37  jveldhuis

	* grab/na/tv_grab_na: backed out moving to ISO-8860 in xml
	  declaration/encoding

2003-02-18 16:07  epaepa

	* filter/tv_sort: pd(): new function, just a wrapper for
	  ParseDate() which dies if the date couldn't be parsed.  This
	  removes the need for an explicit check after every call.  It has
	  a shorter name too.

2003-02-18 15:43  epaepa

	* t/data/tv_sort_test_sort_by_channel_xml.expected: Whoops, forgot
	  to update this expected output file I think.	Well now the
	  expected output from tv_sort for this case is actually sorted
	  :-).

2003-02-18 15:32  epaepa

	* filter/tv_sort, t/data/tv_sort_all_UTF8.expected,
	  t/data/tv_sort_by_channel_all_UTF8.expected: add_stop(): jump
	  through some hoops to avoid making the list of programmes out of
	  order.  This fixes the bug where tv_sort would sometimes generate
	  output that wasn't sorted.  However there are still differences
	  between tv_sort and tv_sort --by-channel on the
	  test_sort_by_channel.xml test case, and I will investigate those
	  further.

2003-02-18 14:49  epaepa

	* filter/tv_sort: check_sorted(): new function to assert that a
	  list is sorted according to a given comparison function.

	  Added calls to check_sorted() after each operation that changes a
	  list of programmes.  This catches the bug in --by-channels, so
	  that tv_sort now dies rather than produce incorrect output.  This
	  is a small improvement.  Next task is to fix the bug.

2003-02-16 11:53  jveldhuis

	* grab/na/tv_grab_na: dates in xml output header is now ISO-8861
	  compliant

2003-02-16 10:51  jveldhuis

	* grab/na/tv_grab_na: fixed pod and now --list-channels produces

	  tv_extractinfo_en_all_UTF8.expected,
	  tv_sort_by_channel_test_sort_by_channel_xml.expected,
	  tv_to_latex_all_UTF8.expected: Oops, I somehow forgot to add
	  test_sort_by_channel.xml's contribution to some of the expected
	  all_UTF8 files, and didn't make the expected output from tv_sort
	  --by-channel on that file the same as that from tv_sort.

2003-02-16 09:20  epaepa

	* t/test_filters.t: Moved tv_sort --by-channel into the main body
	  of tests, since it has a known bug, and moved a few other

	  relatively quick.

	  strange bug where tv_sort --by-channel produces different output
	  from tv_sort, even when all the programmes in the input have the
	  same channel.  This test case demonstrates it (the expected
	  output from tv_sort and tv_sort --by-channel is the same for the
	  input test_sort_by_channel.xml, but the actual outputs currently
	  differ.)

2003-02-16 08:18  epaepa

	* filter/tv_sort: Removed the global %orig_order and moved the
	  'make the sort stable' stuff into a new routine
	  make_stable_sort_function(), which can be applied to
	  \&programme_cmp and a list of programmes, or anything else to
	  that matter.	Now the sorting for --by-channel is also a stable
	  sort.

	  Hmm, this didn't fix the bug I was hoping to fix, still, none of
	  the other tests break and it seems like a good thing.

2003-02-16 07:42  epaepa

	* filter/tv_sort: Made a note that perl 5.8 has a use sort
	  'stable'; pragma and we should make use of that if available.  I
	  won't implement it until I have a perl5.8-equipped box to test
	  with.

2003-02-16 06:41  epaepa

	* grab/na/tv_grab_na: migrateConfigFile(): new routine
	  encapsulating the code that migrates the old config file to the
	  new location.  Instead of being called at the start of the script
	  before parsing options (which incorrectly runs it even when
	  --config-file is given), it now gets called from the configure
	  stage and from the grab stage, but only if $opt_config_file is
	  not set.  This should fix the bug reported by Robert Eden.

2003-02-16 06:33  epaepa

	* grab/na/tv_grab_na: Removed deprecated --config option (use
	  --config-file instead).

2003-02-16 05:58  epaepa

	* xmltv.dtd: Clarified the meaning of start and stop, that they are
	  a half-closed interval.  This is what everybody knew anyway, but
	  it's just as well to have it in writing.

2003-02-16 05:28  epaepa

	* filter/tv_grep.in: Whoops, the documentation of --on-after was
	  completely the opposite of what it does.

2003-02-16 04:25  epaepa

	* grab/nz/tv_grab_nz: Create ~/.xmltv/ if it doesn't already exist.

2003-02-16 04:03  epaepa

	  ~/.xmltv/ directory.

2003-02-15 18:27  epaepa

	* grab/na/tv_grab_na: Moved 'use strict;' to the top of the code so
	  it applies to the whole file.

2003-02-15 18:25  epaepa

	* grab/: fi/tv_grab_fi, na/tv_grab_na, nz/tv_grab_nz,
	  sn/tv_grab_sn, uk/tv_grab_uk.in, uk_rt/tv_grab_uk_rt.in: As
	  mentioned on xmltv-devel, changing the names of all the grabber
	  configuration files to end in '.conf'.  This is so that on
	  Windows, when run from the current directory, they do not try to
	  overwrite themselves.  Thanks to Davide Chiarini for pointing
	  this out.  Also it's probably more obvious what the files are for
	  with '.conf' stuck on the end of the filename.

	  The migration should be automatic, you just get a message saying
	  that the old file is being renamed to end in .conf.  Of course
	  _this_ will go wrong for Windows users running from the current
	  directory, but it's only a short-term measure.

	  Hmm, perhaps some of this config file reading/writing could be
	  factored out.  It's a lot of almost identical code.

2003-02-15 18:10  epaepa

	* grab/nz/tv_grab_nz: If HOME is not set in the environment, look
	  in the current direcetory for the config file.

2003-02-15 17:52  epaepa

	* grab/na/tv_grab_na: Removed another occurrence of ~/.xmltv_na.

2003-02-15 17:48  epaepa

	* grab/nz/tv_grab_nz: Changed strip() method on string object
	  (which is not supported in Python 1.5.2) to use string.strip()
	  function instead.

2003-02-15 17:14  epaepa

	* grab/na/tv_grab_na: Don't migrate config file from old location
	  ~/.xmltv_na, it hasn't been there since 0.4.x.  Besides, I am
	  about to add a new piece of magic config file movement and to
	  have two would be excessive.

2003-02-15 15:40  epaepa

	* mkdist: mkdist now does the uploading to upload.sourceforge.net,
	  though you still have to do the fiddling with SF's web pages by
	  hand.  Made the instructions for that a bit more concise (better
	  to give a URL than to give 'click on X...' instructions IMHO).

2003-02-15 14:54  epaepa

2003-02-15 14:18  epaepa

	* grab/uk/: channel_ids, channel_pkgs/entertainment,

	  intermittent problems with Sky Premiership Plus and Setanta,
	  sorting out the mass of travel channels all called 'travel
	  channel'.

2003-02-15 12:11  epaepa

	* grab/uk/tv_grab_uk.in: Whoops - the last version I checked in was
	  totally broken, because overriding $SIG{__DIE__} with something
	  that does an exit(1) will stop eval {} blocks from working.
	  Sorry.

2003-02-15 03:15  epaepa

	* xmltv.dtd: Clarified the meaning of 'width' and 'height'
	  attributes in <icon>.

2003-02-14 17:12  epaepa

	* filter/tv_to_text: Kenneth Pronovici sent me a manual page

	  XMLTV::parse() fails, but catching the exception doesn't seem to
	  work properly (with perl 5.005).  Still, it might do better with
	  a newer version of perl.

2003-02-08 14:23  epaepa

	* grab/uk/channel_ids: Added XMLTV ids for a whole bunch of local
	  radio stations - but there are many more still to do.

2003-02-08 14:22  epaepa

	* grab/uk/tv_grab_uk.in: init_channels(): tidied up the warn() and
	  die() error reporting.  Now the channel_ids filename and line
	  number is automatically prepended to every error message that
	  happens when reading a line of that file.  Even things that I
	  originally thought of as 'internal errors' are really caused by
	  mistakes in that file.

2003-02-07 17:30  epaepa

	* todo/TASKS.epa: Adding Davide Chiarini's requirement that
	  original language can be present, but unknown.

2003-02-07 17:29  epaepa

	* grab/uk/: channel_ids, channel_pkgs/sport: Added channel Setanta
	  Sports.

2003-02-07 17:20  epaepa

	* lib/XMLTV.pm.PL: Don't use IO::File, use the prehistoric typeglob
	  method for passing filehandles, because I suspect that IO::File
	  was triggering a segfault with perl-5.6.0 on some systems.

2003-02-07 17:11  epaepa

	* grab/uk/: channel_ids, channel_pkgs/gratis, channel_pkgs/scifi,
	  channel_pkgs/sport: Removed a couple of defunct channels: The
	  Racing Channel went out of business, and there no longer seems to
	  be a separate NTL version of Sci-Fi.

	  I have left S4C2 because it broadcasts intermittently, for a few
	  days at a time, and it seems to disppear from the site briefly
	  when none of its listings are present.  You'll get a warning
	  about it if you run the grabber during one of these times.

2003-02-06 17:45  jveldhuis

	* grab/na/ZapListings.pm: zap2it changed again :r they removed the
	  "(ends at HH:MM)" endings on the descriptions in the text
	  listings.  For now, we calculate end of program by the following
	  program, and assume the last program of the day ends at midnight.
	  Otherwise, we need to get the next days listings to figure out
	  the true value.

2003-02-02 12:02  jveldhuis

	* grab/na/ZapListings.pm: yet again, we switch horses on user agent
	  name

2003-02-02 12:01  jveldhuis

2003-02-02 11:09  epaepa

	* xmltv.dtd, filter/tv_grep.in, lib/XMLTV.pm.in: Small change to

	* grab/na/ZapListings.pm: minor comment removal

2003-01-31 10:17  jveldhuis

	* grab/na/tv_grab_na:  - added --release-check true/false to the
	  command line (default is true)
	     Specify whether or not we should attempt to check + for new
	  releases.
	     tv_grab_na does this by default (scraping the contents of the
	  xmltv project
	     page).
	   - reworked some calls to ZapListings new packaging.

2003-01-31 10:16  jveldhuis

	* grab/na/ZapListings.pm:  - reworked scraping/traversal of all
	  zap2it web site pages
	     - removed all hardcoded cookies
	     - removed all hardcoded zap2it server names
	     - removed all hardcoded url with the exception of
	  www.zapit.com/index
	     - now works by scraping www pages for "defined" forms and
	       then uses them, reusing the same UserAgent so cookie
	  management
	       is completely automatic.
	   - userAgent description is 'Mozilla/5.0' for kicks.
	   - added getCurrentReleaseInfo() that may belong in the XMLTV
	  package
	     instead, but its here for now.
	   - identifies and inserts programmes with title=unknown when
	  program
	     holes appear (including holes that span across day boundaries)
	     (emits warning when hole is filled, if --quiet is not used)
	   - reworked packaging a bit because of new form/traversal
	  mechanisms

2003-01-31 09:45  rmeden

	* choose/tv_check/tv_check: don't crash on no episode match for
	  replay scan

2003-01-28 09:53  jveldhuis

	* grab/na/ZapListings.pm: fixed calls to statusMessage

2003-01-26 14:43  epaepa

	* todo/TASKS.epa: A few todo items fished from my inbox.

2003-01-23 20:07  rmeden

	* choose/tv_check/tv_check_doc.html: documented --DDMM switch.
	  Also edited with Mozilla, so it reformatted it bunch

2003-01-23 19:49  rmeden

	* choose/tv_check/tv_check: added --DDMM switch to optinally use
	  that date format in reports

2003-01-22 22:05  rmeden

	* choose/tv_check/tv_check: use channel-id for dislpaly-name if
	  guide doesn't have a channel section.  index channels after guide
	  instead of before in case channels not predefined set show day to
	  empty string to avoid rare undef fix index name in configure
	  mode, so you can just click on a title

2003-01-20 23:33  rmeden

	* lib/exe_wrap.pl: Date::Manip doesn't always deal with numeric
	  time zones correctly.  They have fixed their code, but it's not
	  in wide distribution.  For now, when exe_xmit tries to guess the
	  time zone, let it use some named values.

	  This will be fased out in a few months, once Date::Manip is
	  distributed.

2003-01-19 20:48  rmeden

	* choose/tv_check/tv_check: allow MYREPLAY devices to be included
	  in specialy ReplayTV fuzzy logic checks fix misleading "wrong
	  show in slot" when there is really "NO GUIDE DATA" (hole)

2003-01-19 20:46  rmeden

	* Makefile.PL: specify module path to PerlApp so local libraries
	  (not installed) are used when building xmltv.exe

2003-01-19 11:59  epaepa

	* MANIFEST, Makefile.PL, filter/tv_to_latex, lib/Summarize.pm:
	  Factored out most of tv_to_latex's code into a new library
	  XMLTV::Summarize.

2003-01-19 10:36  jveldhuis

	* grab/na/tv_grab_na: provider description or provider id changes
	  are recoverable during a grab so long at least one matches for
	  the given list of providers for the postal/zip code.

	  during configure stage if the id changes (but the description
	  matches exactly) it gets auto-updated.

2003-01-19 05:37  epaepa

	* todo/TASKS.epa: A couple more todo items.

2003-01-19 01:08  rmeden

	* Makefile.PL: when making windows_dist, don't run UNIX2DOS against
	  a JPG file!

2003-01-18 16:43  jveldhuis

	* grab/na/tv_grab_na: added bug about provider_id matches and
	  provider descriptions

2003-01-18 16:02  epaepa

	* grab/uk/: channel_ids, channel_pkgs/entertainment,
	  channel_pkgs/factual, channel_pkgs/gratis,
	  channel_pkgs/lifestyle, channel_pkgs/music,
	  channel_pkgs/regional: Added some new channels which appeared on
	  the site, both to channel_ids and to an appropriate package or
	  two.	This includes reinstating einstein.tv.

2003-01-18 15:57  epaepa

	* grab/uk/channel_pkgs/not_england: Trying to be slightly less
	  opinionated in my comments.

2003-01-18 15:31  epaepa

	* grab/uk/tv_grab_uk.in: Changes to cope with the site's listings
	  going from 7 days to 4.  First, cope more gracefully when the
	  expected number of days is not present: if every page for a given
	  day is empty, assume that this day and subsequent ones are
	  missing from the site.  This saves a few hits and some verbosity
	  in warning messages.

	  Second, I have reduced the number of days fetched by default to 4
	  (the new maximum).

2003-01-18 11:58  epaepa

	* grab/uk/tv_grab_uk.in: Fixed the warning about 'no channel
	  package or region includes X' - I had forgotten that
	  %channel_pkgs now stores channel objects rather than XMLTV ids.

2003-01-18 11:52  epaepa

	* grab/uk/channel_pkgs/children: Removed two channels from this
	  package after they disappeared from the site and from
	  channel_ids.

2003-01-18 11:51  epaepa

	* grab/uk/channel_ids: Removed a couple of channels which have
	  disappeared from the site.

2003-01-18 09:39  rmeden

	* lib/exe_wrap.pl: fix --share directory processing for those apps
	  that need it.

2003-01-15 19:39  chunkygoodness

	* grab/nz/tv_grab_nz: Removed BUG entry from manpage relating to
	  primetv - no longer relevant now that we are using the ontv url

2003-01-15 13:51  jveldhuis

	* grab/na/tv_grab_na: now sets default system=onscreen for
	  episode-num nodes

2003-01-12 04:13  epaepa

	* mkdist: Rewrote the instructions for uploading a new release to
	  Sourceforge, adding an explanation of what the release notes and
	  changelog should be.

2003-01-11 11:39  epaepa

	* grab/uk/: channel_ids, channel_pkgs/adult, channel_pkgs/children,
	  channel_pkgs/classics, channel_pkgs/comedy,
	  channel_pkgs/entertainment, channel_pkgs/factual,
	  channel_pkgs/film, channel_pkgs/gratis, channel_pkgs/misc,
	  channel_pkgs/sport: Guided by the new warnings in tv_grab_uk, I
	  have removed a lot of defunct channels or defunct duplicates from
	  the channel_ids and packages.

2003-01-11 10:14  epaepa

	* grab/uk/tv_grab_uk.in: When prompting for channels to install,
	  show the user the display name not the XMLTV id.  Better warning
	  if a channel object doesn't have a main display name (shouldn't
	  happen, but it might).

	  init_channels(): set the type of the newly-created channel to
	  'tentative'.	Then if the type is not updated later, we know that
	  this channel appears only in the config file and warn about its
	  removal.

	  get_channel_pkgs(): the hash mapping package name to channels now
	  gives a list of channel objects rather than just the XMLTV ids.
	  We also take the opportunity to check that the XMLTV id in the
	  package file is known (this means that any channel mentioned in a
	  package must also be listed in the channel_ids file so it is
	  known about this early, but that shouldn't be a problem).

	  read_channels_page(): once we've read the channesl from the site
	  we know that any channel objects we haven't updated are 'phantom'
	  channels mentioned in the config file but not found on the site.
	  This function now removes them from the global @ch_all list and
	  from the channel packages set earlier (and complains about it).

2003-01-10 18:17  epaepa

	* Makefile.PL: Corrected LC_ALL detection bug noticed by Robert
	  Boardman; made the message printed more sentenceful.
	  (sententious?  sentent?)

2003-01-07 23:02  rmeden

	* Makefile.PL: fix some bugs in the make windows_dist function

2003-01-07 16:22  jveldhuis

	* mkdist: updated some of the ftp related hints at the end

2003-01-07 10:17  jveldhuis

	* README, doc/README.win32: added blub about some recent changes to
	  the _na grabber

2003-01-07 09:42  jveldhuis

	* grab/na/ZapListings.pm: update form variables required by zap2it

2003-01-06 15:17  chunkygoodness

	* grab/nz/tv_grab_nz: Fixed bug in regular expression that wouldn't
	  match programs with hyper links in their names

2003-01-06 00:32  chunkygoodness

	* grab/nz/tv_grab_nz: Changed parser to use ontv.nzoom.com for all
	  channels - this means that there are descriptions for all
	  channels now, and makes maintenance easier (only one website to
	  track for changes)

2003-01-03 00:30  rmeden

	* choose/tv_check/tv_check: Minor tweak to code that reuses
	  previous show file options during MyReplayTV processing.

2003-01-02 14:46  epaepa

	* Makefile.PL, lib/XMLTV.pm.in: Version 0.5.6.

2003-01-01 15:27  epaepa

	* doc/README.win32: Updated for 0.5.6.	We don't currently know how
	  to fix the % shell metacharacter problem.

2003-01-01 15:03  epaepa

	* README: Updated for 0.5.6.

2003-01-01 14:15  epaepa

	* grab/na/tv_grab_na: Made the configuration file parsing work if
	  there is no version line.  This is partly to make it work with a
	  conf file the user sent me, and partly because the version line
	  does look like a comment.

2003-01-01 12:27  epaepa

	* MANIFEST: Removed file README.tv_check.

2003-01-01 12:10  epaepa

	* MANIFEST, Makefile.PL, README, doc/QuickStart,
	  grab/fi/tv_grab_fi: Adding Matti Arias's tv_grab_fi for Finnish
	  listings.  Hopefully this commit should include all changes
	  needed to add it to the distribution.

	  Also mentioned tv_grab_uk_rt (the ugly sister of tv_grab_uk) in
	  the QuickStart guide, for completeness.

2003-01-01 11:59  epaepa

	* doc/QuickStart: Rephrased the introduction to grabbers, and added
	  mention of tv_split.

2003-01-01 11:51  epaepa

	* README.tv_check: Removing this copy of README.tv_check because it
	  is an exact duplicate (or was until recent changes) of the copy
	  in choose/tv_check/.

2003-01-01 11:49  epaepa

	* grab/uk/channel_pkgs/gratis: Bloomberg TV is no longer gratis.

2003-01-01 11:46  epaepa

	* choose/tv_check/README.tv_check: Make it slightly more explicit
	  that you can run any grabber and not just tv_grab_na... it was
	  probably clear enough already, but what the heck.

2002-12-29 09:55  rmeden

	* choose/tv_check/tv_check: work around a bug where Date::Manip
	  doesn't deal with appended TZ correctly.  The problem has been
	  fixed, but there isn't a real benefit to having the TZ in the
	  times, so dropping them instead adding a later Date::Manip
	  dependency.

2002-12-26 13:05  epaepa

	* doc/README.win32: Oops, I accidentally committed bogus
	  instructions for Windows users.  We're still waiting for a
	  solution to the % problem.

2002-12-26 12:54  epaepa

	* MANIFEST, Makefile.PL, filter/tv_split: Added an implementation
	  of tv_split.	This one does not require the input to be sorted.
	  It tries to be clever and keep one open XMLTV::Writer for each
	  output file, so programmes can be written out as they are read
	  in, but I had to add workaround code for the case when the
	  process runs out of open filehandles.  I haven't added tv_split
	  to the test suite but it seems to work.

2002-12-26 12:52  epaepa

	* lib/XMLTV.pm.in: Added a warning for a common mistake in using
	  XMLTV::Writer - passing a filename where a filehandle is
	  expected.  At least, it's a mistake that I make often.

2002-12-26 07:49  epaepa

	* lib/XMLTV.pm.in: Added some runtime checks to make sure the
	  various XMLTV::Writer methods are called in the right order.

2002-12-25 14:51  epaepa

	* choose/tv_check/tv_check, choose/tv_check/tv_check_doc.html,
	  doc/README.win32, grab/na/ZapListings.pm, grab/sn/tv_grab_sn,
	  grab/uk/tv_grab_uk.in, lib/XMLTV.pm.in: After I found that perl
	  was complaining when run in a UTF-8 locale, I decided to purge
	  all non-ASCII characters from the source code.  The characters
	  were mostly in the code in order to purge bad characters from the
	  web pages fetched :-P.  Now we just use \xAB style hex escapes.

	  Also tidied up the tv_check documentation, it previously had some
	  Microsoftisms including the notorious 'smart quotes' and lumps of
	  non-breaking spaces used for layout.

2002-12-25 14:46  epaepa

	* todo/TASKS.epa: A user pointed out the site satlogo.com which has
	  logos for many channels.  Some of the grabbers might use this
	  data to add <icon> elements.

2002-12-25 10:39  epaepa

	* grab/na/ZapListings.pm: Use URI::new_abs() to make icon URLs
	  absolute, even if the site decides to serve relative URLs in the
	  HTML.

2002-12-23 13:23  epaepa

	* analyse_tvprefs/analyse_tvprefs, choose/tv_pick/tv_pick_cgi,
	  grab/uk/tv_grab_uk.in, grab/uk_rt/tv_grab_uk_rt.in: Fixed several
	  places with configuration-file-parsing code.	You need to strip
	  comments _before_ stripping trailing spaces, otherwise a space
	  before a comment is left.  Hmm, perhaps this should be factored
	  out.

2002-12-23 13:18  epaepa

	* grab/uk/channel_pkgs/gratis: Updated the 'gratis' channel package
	  with those which are currently available on Sky Digital.

2002-12-23 12:57  epaepa

	* grab/uk/channel_ids: Added some comments.

2002-12-23 12:14  epaepa

	* grab/uk/tv_grab_uk.in: Small code simplification.

2002-12-20 19:47  chunkygoodness

	* grab/nz/tv_grab_nz: Fixed tv1 regular expression - the source had
	  changed

2002-12-18 11:05  epaepa

	* grab/uk/tv_grab_uk.in: Small code tidy to remove redundant
	  @all_chs variable.

2002-12-18 10:50  epaepa

	* grab/uk/tv_grab_uk.in: Reintroduced the distinction between
	  national and local radio.  Now you can choose at configuration to
	  download all 25 (currently) national radio stations.

2002-12-18 09:47  epaepa

	* MANIFEST, Makefile.PL, grab/uk/Ananova_Channel.pm,
	  grab/uk/README, grab/uk/channel_ids, grab/uk/tv_grab_uk.in,
	  grab/uk_rt/tv_grab_uk_rt.in: Finally got rid of the
	  Ananova_Channel library for tv_grab_uk.  It seemed like a good
	  idea at the time, providing an OO abstraction around the list of
	  channels and enforcing various properties, but it just became too
	  complex and unwieldy.

	  Actually, so far all I've done is move code out of
	  Ananova_Channel.pm and put it directly into tv_grab_uk.in.  But
	  next I can start cleaning up.

2002-12-17 06:01  epaepa

	* grab/uk/: channel_ids, tv_grab_uk.in: Added a couple of short
	  channel names, Removed a lone $Log::TraceMessages::On which was
	  causing a warning.  Changed a progress bar message to the more
	  accurate 'writing'.

2002-12-17 05:41  epaepa

	* lib/exe_wrap.pl: Untested change to pass a --share argument to
	  the grabbers which need it.

2002-12-16 17:04  epaepa

	* grab/uk/tv_grab_uk.in: The old way of doing 'miscellaneous fixes'
	  was horribly unscalable.  I'm committing a change which fiddles
	  with and writes programmes more linearly; I hope it works since
	  it's not yet tested.

2002-12-16 15:50  epaepa

	* grab/uk/tv_grab_uk.in: Handle EOF at 'enter a channel name' more
	  cleanly (I have yet to add code to handle undef returned from
	  XMLTV::Ask routines).  Fixed channel name comparison - now it
	  should be a substring rather than regexp match, which means the
	  user can't crash the program by typing in a bad regexp.

2002-12-16 15:47  epaepa

	* grab/uk/channel_ids: Added a couple of extra display names
	  corresponding to what the Sky programme guide shows.

2002-12-16 15:46  epaepa

	* lib/Ask.pm: Made more robust against input-reading failures (such
	  as EOF).  Now it is documented that if the input could not be
	  read, undef is returned.

2002-12-14 08:42  epaepa

	* grab/uk/tv_grab_uk.in: Change @XMLTV::Channel_Handlers when
	  parsing the regions page as well as when parsing the channels
	  page.  This is because each <region> contains <channel> elements
	  and they have Ananova's special <distribution> element.  I had
	  forgotten to do this before but didn't notice because there was
	  no warning.

2002-12-14 08:39  epaepa

	* lib/XMLTV.pm.in: Added some more trace statements.

2002-12-14 04:13  epaepa

	* grab/nz/tv_grab_nz: Changed some string functions to make them
	  work with Python 1.5.2.

2002-12-13 16:11  epaepa

	* Makefile.PL: Cahnged the Python version checking to primt
	  sys.hexversion because the Python 1.5.2 interpreter doesn't
	  understand -V.

2002-12-13 16:06  epaepa

	* Makefile.PL: Formatting change for perl 5.005.

2002-12-13 07:32  epaepa

	* README, doc/README.win32: Staffan Malmgren's channel-selection
	  patch to tv_grab_sn has made it into the 0.5.5 release.

2002-12-13 07:26  epaepa

	* grab/nz/tv_grab_nz: Changed configuration behaviour to be more
	  like the other grabbers (just more chatter, really).

2002-12-12 18:52  chunkygoodness

	* grab/nz/tv_grab_nz: Modifed the manpage slightly, as well as
	  added the initial support for the --configure option to select
	  which channels are to be downloaded.

2002-12-12 18:05  epaepa

	* grab/sn/tv_grab_sn: Staffan Malmgren's patch (with a few changes)
	  to add channel selection to --configure (and fix grabbing the
	  list of channels in the first place).

2002-12-12 17:56  epaepa

	* attic/tv_grab_nl, filter/tv_extractinfo_en,
	  grab/uk/tv_grab_uk.in, lib/Ask.pm, lib/XMLTV.pm.in: Global style
	  fix for uncuddled elses as mandated by 'perlstyle'.  A pity that
	  Emacs keeps putting them back again.

2002-12-12 17:10  epaepa

	* grab/uk/tv_grab_uk.in: Fixed splicing bug noticed by Neil
	  Trodden.

2002-12-12 09:49  epaepa

	* lib/exe_wrap.pl: Friendlier error message for tv_grab_nz.

2002-12-12 09:47  epaepa

	* lib/exe_wrap.pl: Generalized this a bit so that each command name
	  has a lump of Perl code associated with it, so we can do exciting
	  things like print a warning message for tv_grab_nz :-).

2002-12-12 05:19  epaepa

	* Makefile.PL, README, doc/QuickStart, doc/README.win32,
	  lib/XMLTV.pm.in: Updated for the forthcoming 0.5.5 release.  But
	  I don't know what to do about tv_grab_nz on Windows.

2002-12-12 04:40  epaepa

	* grab/nz/tv_grab_nz: Tidied the usage message.  Added pod
	  documentation (perhaps a bit odd in a Python program, but it's
	  the easiest way to get a manual page).

2002-12-11 15:56  epaepa

	* README: Added Python to the list of dependencies, at least for
	  tv_grab_nz.

2002-12-11 15:20  epaepa

	* MANIFEST: Added tv_grab_nz to the file list.

2002-12-11 15:18  epaepa

	* Makefile.PL: Now as well as testing module prerequisites with the
	  'prereqs' key, you can specify arbitrary bits of code to be run
	  under 'special_prereqs', with version number comparison as for
	  modules.

	  I've used this to add tv_grab_nz with a dependency on Python
	  1.5.2 or later.

2002-12-11 10:27  epaepa

	* grab/nz/tv_grab_nz: Adding Andre Renaud's New Zealand grabber.
	  Now to arrange the necessary installation gubbins.

2002-12-10 22:26  jveldhuis

	* grab/na/ZapListings.pm: escape @ in messages - thanks Walter D.

2002-12-10 17:04  epaepa

	* grab/uk/tv_grab_uk.in: I had code to add a handler 'distribution'
	  to channel elements, but forgot that this would apply on output
	  as well as input.  After XMLTV.pm.in got fixed I started getting
	  missing key warnings.  So now this extra handler is added only
	  while parsing.

	  Some mysterious undefined values that seem to come out of nowhere
	  have been worked around.  Hopefully they will not occur unless
	  the data from the site is faulty.

2002-12-10 16:58  epaepa

	* grab/uk/Ananova_Channel.pm: Slightly cleaner undefined value
	  warning.

2002-12-10 16:55  epaepa

	* lib/XMLTV.pm.in: Some runtime type errors during writing XML that
	  would previously have aborted the program are now just warnings,
	  with the particular element affected being skipped.

	  A new private routine check_multiplicity() makes sure that a hash
	  has the mandatory elements required by a set of handlers.  The
	  new private routine write_element_with_handlers() calls
	  check_multiplicity() before opening the element, so there is less
	  chance of writing invalid XML from bad Perl data structures.

2002-12-10 16:14  epaepa

	* Makefile.PL: The location of manual pages varies from one system
	  to another.  But I think to keep things simple, for XMLTV they
	  can always be in PREFIX/share/man/ which is the FHS-approved
	  place.

2002-12-08 03:58  epaepa

	* Makefile.PL: Corrected the message given when UTF-8 problems are
	  detected: updating Date::Manip won't fix it, but changing your
	  locale will.	Thanks to Derek J. Kalweit for bringing this to my
	  attention.

2002-12-05 14:50  jveldhuis

	* grab/na/ZapListings.pm: spill out status message when we find
	  star ratings > 4 star - did zap2it change things ?

2002-12-05 14:42  jveldhuis

	* grab/na/ZapListings.pm: properly identify star-ratings given by
	  ***+ instead of ***1/2 for 3.5 star ratings

2002-12-01 10:14  epaepa

	* Makefile.PL, README, doc/README.win32, lib/XMLTV.pm.in: Version
	  0.5.4.

2002-12-01 09:58  epaepa

	* analyse_tvprefs/analyse_tvprefs: Updated link to top 3000 words
	  in the BNC; now it points to my mirror of that page.

2002-12-01 09:22  epaepa

	* grab/uk/: channel_ids, channel_pkgs/adult, channel_pkgs/arts,
	  channel_pkgs/children, channel_pkgs/classics,
	  channel_pkgs/comedy, channel_pkgs/entertainment,
	  channel_pkgs/factual, channel_pkgs/film, channel_pkgs/lifestyle,
	  channel_pkgs/music, channel_pkgs/news, channel_pkgs/scifi,
	  channel_pkgs/sport, channel_pkgs/travel: Added channel ids for
	  some new channels and added them to the appropriate packages.

2002-12-01 09:21  epaepa

	* grab/uk/Ananova_Channel.pm: Fixing an undefined value warning.

2002-12-01 03:12  epaepa

	* mkdist: Now there are two readme files the mkdist reminder needs
	  to mention them both.

2002-12-01 03:04  epaepa

	* grab/sn/tv_grab_sn: Instead of looking for a table in a
	  particular position, we examine all tables on the page and find
	  the one that looks most like it contains listings.  This has
	  fixed the failure with Norwegian listings.

2002-11-30 15:33  epaepa

	* grab/sn/tv_grab_sn: Working out how to fix the grabber for a new
	  site layout.	Added some trace code with Log::TraceMessages and
	  one more error check.

2002-11-28 11:37  jveldhuis

	* grab/na/: ZapListings.pm, tv_grab_na: new rework to support new
	  zap2it cookies etc Special thanks to Stephen Bain for helping me
	  play catch-up with zap2it site changes.

2002-11-23 22:10  rmeden

	* doc/README.win32: Mention the fact that TZ can be determined
	  automatically.

2002-11-23 17:04  epaepa

	* Makefile.PL: Version 0.5.3.

2002-11-23 16:48  epaepa

	* lib/XMLTV.pm.in: Bumping version to 0.5.3.  It seems that the
	  version of the XMLTV module follows that of the xmltv project.

2002-11-23 16:47  epaepa

	* doc/README.win32: Updated the Win32 instructions.  It's nice not
	  to have to mention arcane details of Perl module versions.  The
	  list of contributors could be done better, I haven't worked out
	  the best way of giving credit in the docs.

2002-11-23 16:29  epaepa

	* README: Updated for version 0.5.3; I've tried to summarize the
	  changes but focusing mostly on the emergency tv_grab_na fix.
	  Also I've attempted to explain the Date::Manip problems on Red
	  Hat 8... still waiting for a response from the module's developer
	  on this.

2002-11-23 13:53  epaepa

	* grab/de/tv_grab_de: Better error message when the site appears to
	  be out of date.  This is the signal for me to bring up the page
	  in my web browser and hit 'reload' to kick my proxy server into
	  getting a newer version of the page :-P.

2002-11-23 13:44  epaepa

	* grab/de/tv_grab_de: Added a warning message if --configure is
	  given (this grabber needs and supports no configuration stage).

2002-11-22 09:09  jveldhuis

	* grab/na/ZapListings.pm: now uses tvlistings.zap2it.com as its
	  base instead of tvlistings2 ??

2002-11-19 12:45  epaepa

	* grab/sn/tv_grab_sn: Changed brief description of tv_grab_sn to
	  mention both Sweden _and_ Norway :-).

2002-11-19 09:13  jveldhuis

	* grab/na/tv_grab_na: fixed errrorMessage to be errorMessage

2002-11-19 01:07  epaepa

	* Makefile.PL: HTML::TableExtract 1.08 or later required (found by
	  Kenneth Pronovici).

2002-11-18 15:53  epaepa

	* filter/tv_extractinfo_en: multipart_split_desc(): be more
	  discriminating before deciding it's the Radio Times style.  Look
	  for the word 'at' as well as 'with'.

2002-11-18 12:52  epaepa

	* grab/: de/tv_grab_de, sn/tv_grab_sn, uk/tv_grab_uk.in,
	  uk_rt/tv_grab_uk_rt.in: Adding a --quiet flag to four grabbers;
	  this is in response to Debian bug 169157 and discussions with
	  Kenneth Pronovici.

2002-11-17 18:41  jveldhuis

	* grab/na/tv_grab_na: added option for splitting --listings output
	  by channel number and channel callletters. See pod or --help for
	  details.

2002-11-17 18:40  jveldhuis

	* grab/na/: ZapListings.pm, tv_grab_na: added new --quiet and
	  --stats command line options as per requests to control amount of
	  stderr output.

2002-11-17 10:52  jveldhuis

	* grab/na/tv_grab_na: fixed mkpathtofile so it creates all missing
	  directories

2002-11-16 15:39  epaepa

	* grab/: uk/tv_grab_uk.in, uk_rt/tv_grab_uk_rt.in: Patch from
	  Walter Duncan to add --offset.

2002-11-16 15:33  epaepa

	* grab/sn/tv_grab_sn: Patch from Walter Duncan to improve
	  documentation of --offset.

2002-11-16 04:11  epaepa

	* grab/de/tv_grab_de: Added --offset option, improved warning
	  messages when downloads fail.

2002-11-15 10:24  rmeden

	* choose/tv_check/tv_check: fix MyReplayTV case where day changes
	  and old day is reused

2002-11-12 07:56  rmeden

	* lib/exe_wrap.pl: I thought a script could end with RETURN.
	  Someone had a problem

2002-11-11 14:19  epaepa

	* Makefile.PL: Jerry V. pointed out that string comparison might
	  work better than numeric comparison for version numbers.

2002-11-11 10:27  jveldhuis

	* grab/na/tv_grab_na: fixed documentation w.r.t --output and added
	  some warnings about failing to unlink temperary files

2002-11-11 10:26  jveldhuis

	* grab/na/ZapListings.pm: warn if we can't write to cache

2002-11-09 14:34  epaepa

	* grab/sn/tv_grab_sn: One more illegal character entity to deal
	  with.

2002-11-07 06:20  epaepa

	* filter/tv_extractinfo_en: There was an infinite loop where a
	  programme looked a bit like a multipart, but was 'split' into
	  only one programme, which in turn looked like a multipart...	Now
	  if a programme is split into just one result, special_multipart()
	  decides to leave it alone.

2002-11-07 03:30  epaepa

	* filter/tv_cat, lib/XMLTV.pm.in: Fixed the tv_cat bug reported by
	  Jerry Veldhuis where it duplicates <channel> elements.  The
	  mistake lay in treating parsefiles_callback() as if it could
	  simply be used instead of parsefile_callback(), when in fact a
	  little more checking is needed when getting channels from
	  multiple files.

	  Added a warning to the XMLTV.pm documentation about this.  I
	  might change the way this works later, so that duplicate channels
	  are weeded out in XMLTV.pm and the data returned to the user is
	  always clean: not sure what is best here.

2002-11-07 03:25  epaepa

	* MANIFEST: Oops, I added a few generated test outputs to the file
	  list by mistake.

2002-11-07 03:12  epaepa

	* MANIFEST, t/test_filters.t,
	  t/data/tv_cat_test_xml_test_xml.expected,

	  catch a bug in tv_cat where <channel> elements are duplicated.
	  The expected outputs being committed show the correct behaviour.

2002-11-07 03:09  epaepa

	* grab/uk/tv_grab_uk.in: More informative (if more frightening)
	  error message when the site's pages don't look like XMLTV files.

2002-11-06 12:18  epaepa

	* MANIFEST, grab/uk/channel_ids, grab/uk/channel_pkgs/arts,
	  grab/uk/channel_pkgs/classics, grab/uk/channel_pkgs/comedy,
	  grab/uk/channel_pkgs/entertainment, grab/uk/channel_pkgs/factual,

	  grab/uk/channel_pkgs/scotland, grab/uk/channel_pkgs/shop,
	  grab/uk/channel_pkgs/wales, todo/TASKS.epa: Dealt with the new
	  Ananova television channels, assigned them XMLTV ids and put each
	  in one or more packages.

2002-11-06 12:16  epaepa

	* Makefile.PL: The Makefile depends on grab/uk/channel_pkgs/
	  because every time a new package is added to that directory some
	  new commands need to appear in the Makefile.

2002-11-04 22:41  rmeden

	* lib/exe_wrap.pl: Set the TZ variable if it is not already set.

2002-11-03 10:58  jveldhuis

	* grab/na/tv_grab_na: The following changes have been made to the
	  cvs head revision of tv_grab_na and ZapListings.pm.

	   1. when --output is used, the file is always overwritten
	   2. renamed the newly added --overwrite to --listings-overwrite
	  because it
	      only effects the symanitics of --listings use.
	   3. when no programs are found after getting a page of listings
	  from zap2it,
	      the readSchedule() method returns -2 instead of -1 and so
	  tv_grab_na
	      won't retry these pages. Instead tv_grab_na prints a message
	  similar to:
		 unretry-able error reading schedule for 2002-11-05 for
	  station 2 CFRN
	      and doesn't retry. (thanks Brian for the insight).

2002-11-03 10:52  jveldhuis

	* grab/na/ZapListings.pm: delayed messages about writting files to
	  cache until after scraping the data so we don't report we're
	  writting data to cache we actually unlink afterward because no
	  programs were found.

	  implemented -2 unretry-able errors so no programs aren't retried
	  by tv_grab_na.

2002-11-02 09:43  jveldhuis

	* grab/na/tv_grab_na: In order to make tv_grab_na a bit more
	  resistant to longer server failures at zap2it, it now:

	    - if used with --listings or --output won't re-grab already
	  grabbed listings
	      (this only works if you use at least a day resolution on your
	  filenames)

	    - this behaviour can be over-ridden by using the
	  --overwrite=true on the command line.

	    - format of ending stats has changed a bit. They now include
	  the number of channel
	      listings that failed and the number of listings files that
	  weren't re-grabbed.
	      ie:

	       > checking provider information for postal/zip code 90210,
	  be patient..
	       > double checking channel information, be patient..
	       > listings in tmp-grab/90210/2002-10-29-listings-02 exist,
	  skipping
	       ...
	       > Grabbed 0 programs on 0 channels over 2 day(s) in 0
	  seconds
	       >   not too bad, that's 0.00 programs/sec and 0.00
	  seconds/www page
	       >   does not include 1 failed channel schedule
	       >   does not include 2 output file(s) that already existed

	  WARNING: the default behavour changes the symantics of using
	  --listings or --output      with a filename that doesn't change
	  on a daily basis (ie include %d or equiv).	   So if you use
	  'tv_grab_na --listings out.xml' it will only retrieve fresh
	  listings	 if the out.xml file doesn't exist.

	  Change does not effect writting listings to stdout.

2002-11-02 09:18  jveldhuis

	* grab/na/ZapListings.pm: added a newly used lanugage

2002-10-30 17:04  epaepa

	* grab/uk/: channel_ids, tv_grab_uk.in, channel_pkgs/adult,
	  channel_pkgs/children, channel_pkgs/entertainment,
	  channel_pkgs/film, channel_pkgs/gratis, channel_pkgs/lifestyle,
	  channel_pkgs/not_england, channel_pkgs/shop, channel_pkgs/sport:
	  When I originally wrote this version of the grabber I went
	  through every TV channel listed on the site's 'show=channels'
	  page and added an RFC2838 id for it and assigned it to one or
	  more 'channel packages' if not a terrestrial channel.  But as the
	  site changes new channels appear which are not in any channel
	  package.  They're thus unable to be selected for grabbing.

	  Now the code warns if any channels have appeared which belong to
	  no region and aren't mentioned in any channel package.  It would
	  be better if it could offer to modify your configuration with
	  them (maybe have a special package 'UNKNOWN'), but this is a
	  start.

2002-10-29 10:32  epaepa

	* Makefile.PL: Added a special check for Red Hat's uniquely broken
	  Date::Manip installation.  I hope it works.

2002-10-28 12:30  epaepa

	* todo/TASKS.epa: Added a todo-list item for 'unknown' data.  This
	  is part of the planned new file format.  I probably won't add
	  individual items for each planned change, rather discuss them on
	  the mailing list.

2002-10-27 05:55  epaepa

	* grab/uk_rt/tv_grab_uk_rt.in: Changed the date handling to use the
	  UK_TZ.pm code that was originally written for the Ananova
	  grabber.  Unless the programme details give an explicit timezone
	  we just guess.

	  This probably still has bugs but it is a lot better than it was
	  before.  The local system's timezone will no longer affect the
	  listings output (we set Date::Manip to UTC for everything).  A
	  pity that I did this too late for last night's BST->UTC
	  changeover :-(.

2002-10-27 02:29  epaepa

	* grab/uk_rt/tv_grab_uk_rt.in: Instead of ParseDate() use
	  parse_uk_date() which guesses a timezone.  This was intended to
	  fix the BST/GMT changeover bugs, it does not, but hopefully the
	  code is no worse than before.

	  Changed memoization to get_url() instead of get() because
	  memoizing get() failed for some obscure reason.

2002-10-27 02:28  epaepa

	* MANIFEST, Makefile.PL, grab/uk/UK_TZ.pm, lib/UK_TZ.pm: Moved the
	  library UK_TZ.pm out of the grab/uk/ directory and into lib/,
	  since it will now be used by two grabbers.  (Still haven't
	  decided the best way to organize the directory structure with
	  libraries that are used by only one or two programs, but it's a
	  small issue.)

2002-10-27 02:25  epaepa

	* Uninstall.pm: Made uninstall work correctly with perl 5.005, its
	  File::Find seems a bit broken.

2002-10-27 02:14  epaepa

	* todo/TASKS.epa: Another todo item - I saw the Term::Interact
	  module announced on Usenet.

2002-10-25 13:26  epaepa

	* Makefile.PL: A nicer warning message when a module fails to load.

2002-10-25 13:18  epaepa

	* lib/XMLTV.pm.in: Pod documentation syntax fixes.

2002-10-25 13:14  epaepa

	* MANIFEST: Adding the Windows executable generator to the file
	  list (there's no harm in distributing it as part of the source
	  tarballs and if it's not in MANIFEST you get a warning).

2002-10-24 10:14  jveldhuis

	* grab/na/tv_grab_na: Now supports compressors based on listings
	  file suffix.	added command line options to override gzip/zip and
	  bzip2 compressor command lines.

	  Ya I know I could have used perl packages out there someplace for
	  doing the compression, but I wanted something quick.	The command
	  line options support windoz platforms. And its not like
	  compression of output listings files is required, so if it
	  doesn't work, don't use it.

	  now closes xml output upon failure, so you get valid output to
	  stdout.

	* grab/na/ZapListings.pm: remove pages with no programs from cache

2002-10-23 12:02  rmeden

	* Makefile.PL: Replace leading spaces with tabs in generated
	  Makefile for compatability

2002-10-21 22:25  rmeden

	* lib/exe_wrap.pl: Still working on that file id!

2002-10-21 22:24  rmeden

	* lib/exe_wrap.pl: Fix file ID number

2002-10-21 22:22  rmeden

	* lib/exe_wrap.pl: Initial commit of script used as wrapper for
	  windows EXE

2002-10-21 22:12  rmeden

	* Makefile.PL: Added code to build windows executable

2002-10-20 15:06  epaepa

	* grab/uk/Ananova_Channel.pm: The code I wrote to assign the
	  Tie::RefHash::Nestable namespace never worked, but I didn't
	  realize because I had a newer version of Tie::RefHash in my
	  PERL5LIB.  Thanks to Olaf Klischat for finding the bug and asking
	  on clp.moderated, and to Benjamin Goldberg for posting the right
	  answer.

2002-10-20 11:02  jveldhuis

	* grab/na/ZapListings.pm: will now retry pages returned with no
	  programs

2002-10-20 04:21  epaepa

	* Makefile.PL: Require XML::Twig version 3.09.	This should finally
	  fix the problems with XML::Twig not being detected by the
	  Makefile.PL.	This version of XML::Twig has not yet been
	  officially released to CPAN, you have to get it as a development
	  version from the author's website.  But I'm told it will be
	  released soon.

2002-10-18 15:49  epaepa

	* grab/sn/tv_grab_sn: Improved <span class="..."> HTML matching.

2002-10-18 14:49  epaepa

	* grab/sn/tv_grab_sn: Fixed brown-paper-bag bug with passing a
	  filename where a filehandle was expected.

2002-10-16 11:51  epaepa

	* Makefile.PL: Scott Rose reported that LWP 5.63 had missing
	  methods, but upgrading to 5.65 worked.  So we'll require that
	  version.

2002-10-16 11:31  epaepa

	* Makefile.PL: The minimum required version of XML::Twig is now the
	  latest, 3.08.  This fixes various weird problems that Red Hat 8
	  or Mandrake 9 users have been having, though probably not all of
	  them.  Not all users will strictly need to upgrade but it's way
	  simpler just to get everyone on the same version.

2002-10-15 13:45  epaepa

	* MANIFEST, Makefile.PL, mkdist, doc/README.win32: Added a couple
	  of files to the distribution created by 'make windows_dist': the
	  standard xmltv.dtd, and a new file README.win32 which replaces
	  the standard README.

2002-10-14 13:43  epaepa

	* Makefile.PL: windows_dist: convert all the files to DOS line
	  endings; move READMEs to the top-level directory.

2002-10-13 14:46  epaepa

	* Makefile.PL: The test I put in to check for manual page breakage
	  didn't work because of shell wildcard expansion.

2002-10-11 13:20  epaepa

	* todo/TASKS.epa: Tidied up the todo list, removing lots of dead
	  items and grouping all the things relating to file format.

2002-10-11 13:15  epaepa

	* todo/TASKS.epa: A few more items done, or not doing.

2002-10-11 13:14  epaepa

	* filter/tv_extractinfo_en: Turn 'X interviews...' into a
	  'presenter' credit (though really it would be something more
	  specific if the XMLTV format allowed it).

2002-10-11 13:03  epaepa

	* todo/TASKS.epa: Updated todo list for most recent
	  tv_extractinfo_en change, plus one that I'm not doing.

2002-10-11 13:01  epaepa

	* filter/tv_extractinfo_en: New multipart splitting method: look
	  for 'including at TIME TITLE' in description.  This isn't perfect
	  (the main programme continues afterwards, there is 'followed by
	  weather' which isn't handled, and I'm still not happy about
	  throwing away all the programme's other data when splitting on
	  description) but a further step in the War On English.

2002-10-11 11:23  epaepa

	* filter/tv_extractinfo_en, todo/TASKS.epa: A few more todo-list
	  items.

	  special_credits(): 'Written by' and just 'By' create a 'writer'
	  credit.  Some of the extractor regexps have been tweaked to
	  preserve sentence boundaries better.	A sentence 'X concludes the
	  series' makes X a presenter and adds the new text 'Last in
	  series' - which some day might be picked up by another handler.

	  special_new_series(): recognize a wider range of 'New series'
	  sentences.

	  special_useless(): recognize and remove 'Coverage of' anywher at
	  the start of a sentence.

2002-10-11 09:14  epaepa

	* todo/TASKS.epa: Crossed off another todo list item (recent
	  tv_extractinfo_en changes).

2002-10-11 09:05  epaepa

	* filter/tv_extractinfo_en: The name regular expressions were made
	  weaker to accommodate names like 'LL Cool J' (sigh).	But I added
	  a negative lookbehind test to make sure that 'the' does not
	  precede a name unless it is part of the name.  How many of these
	  lookbehind and lookahead tests should be part of $NAME_RE, and
	  how many part of the regexps which embed it, is still to be
	  sorted out.

	  special_category(): report more accurately whether the programme
	  has been changed.

	  special_credits(): work on all the descriptions in the right
	  language, not just the first.  Improved some of the extractor
	  regexps, and more extractors now examine categories, or the
	  presence of an existing person with the same job, to see whether
	  they should run.  Did away with the silly (non?)optimization of
	  'caches' stored in the programme details listing people in a
	  given job.  It is not possible for a person to both be a guest
	  and do some other job.

2002-10-11 08:36  epaepa

	* t/data/tv_extractinfo_en_clump_extract_1_xml.expected: I think
	  this test file didn't get committed earlier for some reason.

2002-10-10 13:45  epaepa

	* grab/sn/tv_grab_sn: Oops, a really stupid bug that got into
	  0.5.2: forgot to check the $have_bar variable before calling
	  Term::ProgressBar methods.

2002-10-10 13:05  epaepa

	* filter/tv_extractinfo_en: The assignmnent of new categories is a
	  bit subtler: it looks at all the programme's titles and
	  descriptions which are in English, and knows that mention of
	  'news' in a soap opera doesn't make it a news show.

	  'With' in game show means presenter, not actor (just as already
	  for news, business, etc).

2002-10-10 12:16  epaepa

	* filter/tv_extractinfo_en: Removed some references to 'en'
	  scattered around the code, now there is a routine pair_ok() to
	  tell you whether a [ text, lang ] pair is eligible for
	  processing, and if you must use the language directly then use
	  the variable $LANG.

2002-10-10 11:58  epaepa

	* filter/tv_extractinfo_en: Parse a sentence like 'Roy Hattersley
	  guests'.

2002-10-10 10:38  epaepa

	* grab/sn/tv_grab_sn: Added a couple of features which the other
	  dagenstv grabber had: real <channel> elements and fixing a few
	  more HTML entities.

	  Added a progress bar, where available.

2002-10-10 10:33  epaepa

	* mkdist: Updated the instructions to reflect the new naming
	  convention for file releases.   (Just '0.5.2' not 'xmltv-0.5.2'
	  which is kinda redundant.)

2002-10-10 08:46  epaepa

	* README: Removed references to slowness of test suite - it's not
	  so bad now.

2002-10-10 08:28  epaepa

	* README: Improved summary of changes since last release: it's
	  harder to remember what other people have committed :-(.

2002-10-10 07:45  epaepa

	  Made sure that in the callback interface, if a callback is
	  undefined it won't be called (as the docs say).

2002-10-10 05:20  epaepa

	* grab/na/tv_grab_na: Cahnged the xmlDecl() call so that it doesn't
	  output standalone="yes".  I don't know what that does, but the
	  other grabbers don't produce it so we might as well be
	  consistent.

2002-10-10 05:07  epaepa

	* grab/: uk/channel_ids, uk_rt/channel_ids: BBC Knowledge is now
	  called BBC4, although the XMLTV id is still knowledge.bbc.co.uk
	  for now.

2002-10-10 05:05  epaepa

	* grab/uk_rt/tv_grab_uk_rt.in: Don't download categories unless
	  $GET_CATEGORIES is on, which it isn't.  When a page says 'no
	  programmes available' then assume this is deliberate and don't
	  print a warning.  Warnings that are printed should have the URL
	  prepended.

2002-10-10 04:44  epaepa

	* grab/uk_rt/channel_ids: Removing duplicate entry for RT channel
	  248.

2002-10-10 04:43  epaepa

	* grab/uk_rt/tv_grab_uk_rt.in: Errors in the config file should be
	  warned about with name and line number, not 'FH' :-P.

2002-10-10 04:38  epaepa

	* Makefile.PL, README, doc/QuickStart, lib/XMLTV.pm.in: Preparing
	  for 0.5.2 release.  Just a bit more testing first.

2002-10-10 04:36  epaepa

	* grab/uk_rt/tv_grab_uk_rt.in: Use the extra display names for

2002-10-10 04:15  epaepa

	* MANIFEST, Makefile.PL, grab/uk_rt/channel_ids,
	  grab/uk_rt/tv_grab_uk_rt, grab/uk_rt/tv_grab_uk_rt.PL,
	  grab/uk_rt/tv_grab_uk_rt.in: Moved tv_grab_uk_rt's lookup table
	  of Radio Times channel ids into a separate file installed under
	  share/ and read at runtime - exactly the same way tv_grab_uk does
	  it.

2002-10-10 03:20  epaepa

	* grab/uk_rt/tv_grab_uk_rt: Added a pod manual page.  The configure
	  routine now has a stern warning (and no downloading happens
	  unless you choose to proceed).  The %channels hash is no longer a
	  global variable.

2002-10-09 14:52  epaepa

	* filter/tv_extractinfo_en: A new category 'talk' is set
	  automatically if a show mentions the word 'interviews'; it
	  affects the handling of 'with X' (treated as presenter, not
	  actor).

2002-10-09 14:44  epaepa

	* filter/tv_extractinfo_en: 'X introduces...' means X is a
	  presenter.

	  Removed meaningless phrase 'Coverage of'.

2002-10-09 14:14  epaepa

	* filter/tv_extractinfo_en: Change 'X round-up' to 'Xs'.  Hey, it
	  works for X = 'Headline'...

2002-10-09 12:24  epaepa

	* filter/tv_extractinfo_en: Handle a fourth kind of multipart
	  programme: that which has times in the form 'from-to' followed by
	  title and description.

	  Remove the phrase 'round-up of' since it has no meaning.  Eg
	  'round-up of news' becomes just 'news'.

2002-10-09 09:18  epaepa

	* filter/tv_extractinfo_en: special_multipart(): now handles two
	  styles of multipart programme found in the Radio Times listings,
	  as well as the Ananova style.

2002-10-09 07:46  epaepa

	* MANIFEST, lib/Clumps.pm,
	  t/data/tv_extractinfo_en_all_UTF8.expected: I've more or less
	  given up on fixing Clumps.pm; instead I've just removed the
	  sanity check about the times of replacement programmes being
	  within those of the old programme.  It relates to cases where a
	  programme in the middle of a clump is altered or replaced.  I
	  know what the Right Thing is here, but the Clumps.pm code is such
	  a mess I can't be bothered to implement it now.

	  Luckily all this clumps stuff will go out the window when the DTD
	  is revised.

2002-10-09 07:13  epaepa

	  know what is triggering it.

2002-10-07 12:08  epaepa

	* filter/tv_extractinfo_en: For a long time now there has been a
	  nuke_from_rel() call when a programme has been fully processed,
	  forgetting the information of which programmes it shares a clump
	  with.  The idea was that once a programme has been dealt with, we
	  don't need to keep track of it any more.  'Probably not needed,
	  but can't hurt' said the comment: tempting fate if ever that was
	  done.

	  No, we may need to modify a programme even once it has been fully
	  munged, because if others in the clump have been deleted we will
	  need to update its clumpidx.	So it shouldn't be removed from the
	  relation.  Getting rid of that call initially caused a section of
	  code in Clumps.pm (which had never been run before) to break.
	  But it should all be fixed now, I hope.

	  Also added some trace messages.

2002-10-07 12:05  epaepa

	* t/data/tv_extractinfo_en_all_UTF8.expected: This is the expected
	  result from tv_extractinfo_en, now that I've stopped it crashing
	  or printing warnings (fix to be committed).  Confusingly, the
	  programme 'News; Weather' is not split into two, although one day
	  it might be.

2002-10-07 11:59  epaepa

	* lib/Clumps.pm: A while ago I came across a mystifying
	  misbehaviour in perl, and I added all sorts of debugging and
	  wrapper routines like set_stop_time() to track it down.  I never
	  did get to the bottom of the problem, but later on some of the
	  code was moved out of tv_extractinfo_en into this module.  A call
	  to set_stop_time() was left in but until now, it has never been
	  called!  That was due to a bug in the programs using this module
	  I think.

	  Anyway, hoping that I won't be bitten again by this bug (or that
	  if I will be, then a special routine set_stop_times() offers no
	  protection), I have changed the call to just '$foo->{stop} = x'.

2002-10-07 11:55  epaepa

	* MANIFEST: Adding new test input to file list.  (But the expected
	  outputs have yet to be generated.)

2002-10-07 11:51  epaepa

	* t/data/: clump_extract.xml, tv_cat_all_UTF8.expected,
	  tv_grep_channel_xyz_or_channel_b_all_UTF8.expected,
	  tv_sort_all_UTF8.expected, tv_to_latex_all_UTF8.expected: This
	  test case uncovers a bug in tv_extractinfo_en related to breaking
	  up programmes which are part of a clump.  I haven't yet fixed the
	  bug, so the full test results aren't part of this checkin.

2002-10-07 11:43  epaepa

	* lib/Clumps.pm: It is morally better to use nested hashes rather
	  than concatenating two strings into a hash key.

2002-10-04 14:07  epaepa

	* grab/uk_rt/tv_grab_uk_rt: Whoops, forgot that best_name()
	  requires a _list_ of allowable languages.

2002-10-04 14:01  epaepa

	* filter/tv_extractinfo_en: Corrected programme length calculation
	  (Date_Calc() returns an object you then have to turn into a
	  number of seconds with Delta_Format()).  Fixed a couple of
	  undefined value warnings.  Stopped using [:punct:] character
	  class which isn't supported in perl 5.005.

2002-10-04 06:04  epaepa

	* lib/XMLTV.pm.in: Added an extra warning.

2002-10-04 06:01  epaepa

	* filter/tv_extractinfo_en: Try to grok 'Classic Austrailian
	  western' and similar programme descriptions.	Made small tweaks
	  to full stops and spacing when pasting sentences together.

2002-10-03 19:53  rmeden

	* choose/tv_check/tv_check: if bug where a title of \d\d\d\d get's
	  interpreted as a date.

2002-10-03 15:01  epaepa

	* grab/uk_rt/tv_grab_uk_rt: Changed the progress messages to print
	  a human-readable channel name rather than the XMLTV id (which
	  should normally be hidden from the user).

	  Times in the output now conform to what the DTD says and are in
	  the same format as tv_grab_uk.

	  When a page fails to parse, just print the URL and not the whole
	  content, because that gets excessive.

2002-10-03 14:40  epaepa

	* grab/uk/tv_grab_uk.in: grab(): the earlier change to use the
	  arguments passed in for creating an XMLTV::Writer neglected the
	  need to set the encoding based on the data we parsed from the
	  site.  So it is not possible to begin writing any XML until we
	  know the encoding to use.

2002-10-03 14:13  epaepa

	* grab/uk_rt/tv_grab_uk_rt: Attempt to keep going when the basic
	  HTML munging fails.

2002-10-03 13:57  epaepa

	* grab/uk_rt/tv_grab_uk_rt: I had removed most of the progress
	  indicators from the code in the hope of replacing them with
	  Term::ProgressBars like the other grabbers use.  But I think that
	  will take time to sort out (there are various routines calling
	  other routines, the total number of pages to grab isn't known at
	  the outset but is very large) so for the next release I've gone
	  back to quick-and-dirty print STDERR '#'.

2002-10-03 13:39  epaepa

	* grab/uk_rt/tv_grab_uk_rt: Whoops, I committed the code with it
	  set to grab yesterday's listings.  Fixed.

	  Made the grabbing more robust against download failures: where
	  possible it will just skip the details for that programme.

2002-10-03 10:55  epaepa

	* grab/uk_rt/tv_grab_uk_rt: Dealt with the remaining bits of data
	  that were thrown away; now almost everything on the site is
	  included in the XMLTV output.  There are three things which
	  cannot be written out because the DTD doesn't have provision for
	  them: the names of parts played by each actor, the link text and
	  description for each URL, and a signed-for-the-deaf flag.  These
	  are now warned about just once per run, I hope to add them to the
	  DTD when we overhaul it.

2002-10-02 13:21  epaepa

	* choose/tv_pick/tv_pick_cgi: Oops, in my attempt to make the code
	  work without Lingua::EN::Numbers::Ordinate installed I think I
	  broke it when that module is installed.  This patch might fix the
	  problem.

2002-10-02 12:12  epaepa

	* grab/uk_rt/tv_grab_uk_rt: Small refactoring.

2002-10-02 11:29  epaepa

	* grab/uk_rt/tv_grab_uk_rt: Improvements to parsing; now it
	  understands links to related websites, and follow-on programmes.

2002-10-02 04:02  epaepa

	* grab/uk_rt/tv_grab_uk_rt: get_programme_details(): instead of
	  munging the HTML into a big string with | characters and using
	  regexps on it, split the string into a list of 'bits' and process
	  each individually.  This has made some things like sub-title and
	  description more robust, previously they might not get noticed.
	  I've also added warning messages for when some information is
	  discarded or ignored; each of these represents a to-do item.

2002-10-01 20:40  rmeden

	* choose/tv_check/tv_check: added Length field to myreplaytv fetch

2002-10-01 15:12  epaepa

	* grab/uk_rt/tv_grab_uk_rt: Mostly cosmetic changes to HTML
	  'parsing'.

2002-10-01 08:54  epaepa

	* grab/uk_rt/tv_grab_uk_rt: Added a --configure option based on
	  that of tv_grab_uk.  There are no regions, packages or channel
	  types (radio vs television), so for now you just have to type in
	  the names of channels.  It's likely the Radio Times site does
	  have some type information associated with each channel which we
	  could use; alternatively there could be some common table of
	  channel information between this grabber and tv_grab_uk.

	  In fact, common / centralized configuration of grabbers is
	  definitely something to look into.

	  Eliminated some global variables, and changed some routines to
	  pass around Date::Manip objects rather than weird time strings.

	  Changed some warning messages which were wrong before, and
	  improved the robustness of get_available_dates()'s HTML parsing.

	  Added usage message and --days option to go along with
	  --configure: but not all of the grabber options are fully working
	  yet.	--share is completely pointless at the moment since there
	  are no data files used by this grabber, but I hope to move the
	  big channel data hash into a share/ data file at some point.

	  Reduced occurrences of the magic string 'radiotimes.beeb.com',
	  etc.	Fixed <tv> element credits.

2002-10-01 08:43  epaepa

	* lib/Clumps.pm: More informative warning message.

2002-10-01 08:42  epaepa

	* grab/uk/tv_grab_uk.in: grab(): it claimed that the arguments
	  passed in were given to XMLTV::Writer, but in fact it ignored
	  them.  Now the code does what the comment says.

	  Improved laziness (a little) by writing channels, etc. as soon as
	  we get the data.  Programmes are still in a lump however.

	  This change hasn't been tested, I'll do that when I get access to
	  a (fast, etc) network connection.

2002-10-01 08:40  epaepa

	* filter/tv_grep.in: I had misunderstood the /o flag for regular
	  expressions.	If you create a closure which captures $foo, and do
	  a regexp /$foo/o, then it really will be just one value of $foo
	  throughout the whole program, even if different closures had
	  captured different values.  This caused a bug where you couldn't
	  give the same programme content test twice with different
	  regexps.

2002-10-01 08:38  epaepa

	* MANIFEST: Adding new test case files to MANIFEST.

2002-10-01 08:36  epaepa

	* t/: test_filters.t,
	  data/tv_grep_channel_xyz_or_channel_b_all_UTF8.expected,
	  data/tv_grep_channel_xyz_or_channel_b_amp_xml.expected,

	  data/tv_grep_channel_xyz_or_channel_b_whitespace_xml.expected,
	  data/tv_grep_channel_xyz_or_channel_b_x-whatever_xml.expected:
	  Found a bug in tv_grep with specifying --channel twice (or any
	  programme content test twice, it turns out); here is a test case.

2002-09-30 06:19  epaepa

	* lib/XMLTV.pm.in: Refactored the 'unknown key foo in bar hash'
	  warnings into the routine warn_unknown_keys().

2002-09-30 06:17  epaepa

	* Makefile.PL: Now that tv_grab_uk_rt no longer has any unusual
	  dependencies, it can be installed by default and without
	  prompting.  Although I really ought to do something more
	  consistent between parts which are prompted for and parts which
	  aren't.

2002-09-30 05:46  epaepa

	* grab/uk_rt/tv_grab_uk_rt: Made sure the XML is valid by cleaning
	  up ('demoronizing') a couple of non-Latin-1 characters which were
	  being carried through from the HTML pages.

	  Removed retry-fetching, I may add it back later if it proves to
	  be needed.  But it interferes with caching which is a nuisance
	  for development.

	  Changed non-standard keys in hashes to begin with an underscore,
	  so XMLTV::Writer will silently skip them rather than complaining.

	  Added some more error checking, in particular a check that
	  regular expression matches actually succeed before we go off and
	  use captured strings.

	  Strip leading and trailing whitespace from titles and
	  descriptions.

	  Rejigged the channel handling a little; now we try to use XMLTV
	  ids internally and only convert them to Radio Times ids when
	  contacting the site.	Also, only the channels which are actually
	  used are written out as <channel> elements, and with the correct
	  id.  Still some more to do here, in particular a real
	  configuration stage.

	  Added prototypes for all subroutines.

	  Cosmetic formatting, indentation and code style changes.

	  Removed use of Time::ParseDate, now we use Date::Manip
	  exclusively for that stuff.

2002-09-29 12:25  epaepa

	* MANIFEST, Makefile.PL: Added tv_grab_uk_rt to the makefile
	  machinery.

2002-09-29 12:24  epaepa

	* t/parallel_test: Sorting is necessary to compare the output of
	  tv_grab_uk from the 0.5 release with that in 0.5.1.  The order of
	  the XML output has changed.

	  (Also it's necessary to turn off $KEEP_ENCODING in XMLTV.pm, if
	  you want to get the same output from the grabber.)

	  I'm pleased to report that with the exception of cases which
	  crashed the old version of the grabber, the output of old and new
	  is unchanged up to sorting.

	  BTW, if anyone else wants to know how to use this script (like to
	  check that tv_grab_na still works after some major change to the
	  code), do ask.  I plan to start using it for tv_grab_sn and
	  tv_grab_uk_rt as well.

2002-09-29 12:09  epaepa

	* grab/uk_rt/tv_grab_uk_rt: Made warnings-clean, and turned the
	  commented-out category-fetching code into a configurable option
	  (though I haven't yet tested it).

2002-09-29 12:08  epaepa

	* grab/uk_rt/tv_grab_uk_rt: Adding Jerome Benedict Hettich's Radio
	  Times grabber, which was written as part of a group project at
	  the Department of Computing, Imperial College - another case of
	  someone in the same department using XMLTV without me knowing!
	  He sent it to me a while ago but I never got around to adding it.

	  At the moment it does a pretty good job of fetching data from the
	  Radio Times site - their listings are very detailed, particularly
	  in giving the cast of each programme.  And they stretch to two
	  weeks whereas Ananova's go to one.  I believe that the RT data is
	  'completely unrelated' to the Press Association feed which
	  Ananova uses, but I'll investigate later whether there are
	  similarities.

2002-09-29 05:46  epaepa

	* grab/sn/tv_grab_sn: Added --offset option needed by mythtv.  This
	  will eventually be replaced by standard grabber options.

2002-09-28 22:23  rmeden

	* choose/tv_check/tv_check: MyReplayTV fetches now retains options
	  set with --configure MyReplayTV warning about not being able to
	  guess the show day improved MyReplayTV uses old day if show not
	  on the schedule this week Title-only header now includes all set
	  fields so you can see the options.

2002-09-28 16:49  epaepa

	* filter/tv_extractinfo_en: Found a mysterious bug and added some
	  more error handling and trace messages in an attempt to track it
	  down.  Then for some reason renaming one variable @progs to @pps
	  made the bug go away again.

2002-09-28 15:15  epaepa

	* filter/tv_extractinfo_en: Adding some more function prototypes.

2002-09-28 11:31  epaepa

	* grab/uk/Ananova_Channel.pm: Fix lone 'our' that crept in - I want
	  to keep 5.005 compatibility.

2002-09-28 08:20  epaepa

	* Uninstall.pm: Clearer error message.

2002-09-28 06:39  epaepa

	* grab/sn/tv_grab_sn: Rewritten the output routines to use
	  XMLTV::Writer.  Now this grabber should generate valid XML every
	  time.

2002-09-28 06:38  epaepa

	* filter/tv_grep.in, lib/XMLTV.pm.in: I realized that the handling
	  of attributes in XMLTV.pm was very buggy.  Some like 'showview'
	  had never worked!  Now the list of attributes is centralized and
	  returned as part of the output of list_programme_keys() - so that
	  routine really does tell you all the keys that might be in a
	  programme hash.

	  The change to list_programme_keys() means tv_grep has sprouted a
	  lot of new tests, including a somewhat-redundant --channel.

2002-09-28 06:31  epaepa

	* MANIFEST: Added attrs.xml and its test cases to the file listing.

2002-09-28 06:02  epaepa

	* t/data/: tv_to_latex_amp_xml_dups_xml.expected,
	  tv_to_latex_clump_xml_dups_xml.expected: A couple of test cases I

2002-09-28 05:53  epaepa

	* t/test_filters.t: Previously testing would rely on particular
	  filenames appearing first alphabetically.  But of course this
	  completely breaks when you add new filenames in the middle.
	  Rather than rename things to 00amp.xml, etc, I have gone for the
	  only slightly smaller kludge of reordering files by hand in this
	  script.

	  Should fix properly some time.  Maybe a separate configuration
	  file should list the tests to run.

2002-09-24 19:46  jveldhuis

	* grab/na/: ZapListings.pm, tv_grab_na: Animated became a category.
	   'Live', 'Call-in', 'If Necessary' and 'Subject to Blackout' are

	  the sake of testing the multifile functionality, but also we can
	  speed up the test suite because what used to take ten runs of
	  tv_foo can now be done in one run giving ten input files.

	  We don't test all possible lists of files, only a few of the
	  possible pairs, but still it bloats the test suite to
	  unmanageably large numbers of tests (over 1000).  I've remedied
	  that by defining a smaller set of tests, including running each
	  filter program on every input file at once, and making this the
	  default.  If you have a fast computer or time to spare you can
	  get the complete set of tests with the --full option.

	  The files like tv_cat_all_UTF8.expected are for the testing of
	  every input file (actually, every input file with UTF-8 encoding)
	  at once.

	* filter/tv_sort: Store the original ordering of programmes to
	  guarantee a stable sort when two different programmes are not
	  comparable.  (Which should never happen in sane input, but...)

	  Added prototype declaration for data_eq().

2002-09-23 07:45  epaepa

	* lib/XMLTV.pm.in: Properly fixed the bug with empty files, so it
	  works when you have two empty files in a row on the command line.
	  Cleaned up the whitespace handling: it should be stripped on
	  reading, but not on writing (no need to do both).

2002-09-23 06:53  epaepa

	* t/data/: clump.xml, tv_cat_whitespace_xml.expected,

2002-09-22 06:15  epaepa

	* filter/tv_extractinfo_en: Changed to use the callback style -
	  although at present it just gathers all the programmes into a big
	  list as before.

2002-09-22 06:11  epaepa

	* filter/tv_extractinfo_en: Moved the list of programme handlers
	  into munge().

2002-09-22 06:08  epaepa

	* filter/tv_extractinfo_en: Small refactoring: new routine munge()
	  taking a programme and returning a list of programmes.  It's not
	  much use yet because it still needs the whole list of programmes
	  available in case there are others in the same clump.

2002-09-22 03:37  epaepa

	* lib/XMLTV.pm.in: parsefiles_callback(): Now works when one of the
	  input files is empty - previously the 'next file' routine would
	  be called only when a programme was read, and so a file without
	  programmes would not trigger it.

2002-09-21 11:53  epaepa

	* lib/XMLTV.pm.in: Give a clearer indication of what is going on
	  with unspecified encodings.

2002-09-21 10:16  epaepa

	* t/test_filters.t: Generalized to allow more than one input file
	  for each test (although this is not yet used).  Run the commands
	  with 'perl -Iblib/lib ...' rather than the versions installed on
	  the system (I can't believe this wasn't fixed earlier).

2002-09-21 10:13  epaepa

	* lib/XMLTV.pm.in: Taken account of the fact that XML::Twig's
	  encoding() method may return undef and so the encoding is
	  unknown.

2002-09-21 10:07  epaepa

	* filter/tv_grep.in: Cosmetic change.

2002-09-21 10:04  epaepa

	* filter/tv_cat: Added a check that the encoding callback doesn't
	  get called twice.  It should be called just once, before all the
	  others - and this remains true even if parsing several files.

	* README.tv_check, choose/tv_check/README.tv_check,

2002-09-21 06:29  epaepa

	* filter/tv_sort: tv_sort was using Data::Dumper for a deep
	  equality test between two programmes.  It would stringify them
	  both and check the strings were equal.  As the comment said 'we
	  assume that Data::Dumper lists hash keys in a consistent order'.
	  Alas, this is not the case, at least not for all perls.  I've had
	  to write an equality routine to compare different kinds of data
	  structures (since there doesn't seem to be one already, amazingly
	  enough) and call that instead.

	  This fixes a couple of test failures with perl 5.005_03, which I
	  have decided to keep supporting for a while longer.

2002-09-21 05:48  epaepa

	* filter/: tv_extractinfo_en, tv_grep.in: Modified the manual pages

2002-09-21 03:11  epaepa

	* filter/: tv_cat, tv_extractinfo_en, tv_grep.in, tv_sort,
	  tv_to_latex: Changed the filter programs to use parsefiles(), so
	  they can take multiple filenames on the command line.  (Apart
	  from tv_cat, which was already changed to use
	  parsefiles_callback(); I've just updated its documentation.)

	  put some more tests in for tv_cat.  Like checking that
	  concatenating a file with itself and then tv_sorting is the
	  identity, or that concatenating X and the empty file gives X.  So
	  far I have just spotted that there was no test XML file for an
	  empty listing, and added one.  More tests to follow.

2002-09-20 15:54  epaepa

	* filter/tv_cat: Rewritten to use the stream-based interface: this
	  means that tv_cat has gradual output (rather than reading
	  everything first then outputting it all at once) and takes less
	  memory.

2002-09-20 14:18  epaepa

	* lib/XMLTV.pm.in: I had forgotten to honour the $KEEP_ENCODING
	  flag in the callback interface - fixed.

	  Extended the multiple-files stuff to the old-style lump-of-data
	  interface: now instead of parsefile() there is parsefiles().
	  It's implemented as a wrapper around the callback interface.

2002-09-20 13:13  epaepa

	* mkdist, lib/XMLTV.pm.in: Straight after releasing a new
	  stream-based reading interface with 0.5.1, I go and deprecate it.
	   Now there are callbacks for encoding and credits as well as
	  channels and programmes; it just works out simpler that way.	The
	  new routine parsefiles_callback() reads more than one file and
	  concatenates them in an exceedingly cunning way, by having
	  several XML::Twigs on the go at once, so that you can get all the
	  channels and then lazily read programmes from each file in turn.
	  I plan to make tv_cat use this so it won't require so much memory
	  (not that tv_cat gets used much anyway).  Also the other filter
	  programs, when I switch them to the stream-based interface, will
	  get for free the ability to read from multiple input files in the
	  Unix tradition.

	  Noticed another place where I'd forgotten to update the version
	  number, and added it to mkdist.

2002-09-20 05:22  epaepa

	* Makefile.PL: Trying to automate making a Windows binary release.
	  Apart from the executables themselves, because you need some
	  payware tool for that.  But everything else (documentation and
	  share/ files).  This is done with a new target 'windows_dist'
	  which does a normal install and then removes / rearranges files
	  to make them suitable to give to a Windows user.  It's a bit of a
	  kludge but so is everything with MakeMaker.

	  I was held up doing this by a couple of weird bugs in MakeMaker:
	  relative paths as the install target tend to screw up, and the
	  same happens if you do 'perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=...', build, and
	  then try to reconfigure with a different prefix.  (You need to
	  'make distclean' to remove stale files first.)  I've tried to
	  warn the user about both of these in the Makefile.PL.

2002-09-20 02:51  epaepa

	* Makefile.PL: Oops, forgot to update the version number.  This
	  meant the 0.5.1 release installed its documentation in
	  xmltv-0.5/, hopefully that is the only bug it caused.

	  At least mkdist checks for this now, so it can't happen again
	  (cough).

2002-09-20 02:49  epaepa

	* mkdist: Made the version number check do Makefile.PL as well as
	  README.  I've removed the auto-update-and-check-in code because I
	  don't like the idea of checking things in without a human
	  inspecting them first (even if it's unlikely mkdist would really
	  screw up).

2002-09-19 15:12  epaepa

	  $KEEP_ENCODING flag in XMLTV.pm.

	  This means that grabbing a data source in (say) Latin-1, and then
	  processing the data further, will keep the original encoding and
	  not change it to UTF-8.  Not ideal but at least it should work
	  the same on all systems.

2002-09-15 11:11  epaepa

	* grab/uk/tv_grab_uk.in, lib/XMLTV.pm.in: XMLTV.pm.in: added new
	  cat_noprogrammes() function which combines data for encoding,
	  credits, and channels - but not programmes.  This is in line with
	  the general policy of allowing programmes to be processed
	  individually rather than in one big lump.

	  tv_grab_uk.in: changed to use cat_noprogrammes() instead of just
	  cat() in an effort to reduce the working set size, or at least to
	  give it better locality.  Previously tv_grab_uk would rearrange
	  the order of programmes and then output them by channel, which
	  thrashed the disk a lot.  This is not the last change to
	  tv_grab_uk to improve scalability, just an intermediate point to
	  commit a working version.

2002-09-15 07:06  epaepa

2002-09-13 08:32  epaepa

2002-09-13 08:29  epaepa

	* filter/: tv_extractinfo_en, tv_grep.in, tv_sort, tv_to_latex: I

	  timezone thinking this was the same as UTC give or take a few
	  seconds.  But some book I read says that UT is twelve hours out
	  (why?).  So I've changed it to UTC.

	  tv_to_latex: try to cope with both UTF-8 and Latin-1 input files,
	  and do something vaguely sensible with other weird encodings.

2002-09-13 08:24  epaepa

	* choose/tv_pick/tv_pick_cgi: Produce the output HTML in the same

2002-09-10 08:33  epaepa

	* lib/XMLTV.pm.in: Experimental code trying to work round a bug
	  reported by Joe Drew.  The $KEEP_ENCODING constant, if true,
	  turns on XML::Twig's KeepEncoding() option and tries to make the
	  encoding returned from read_data() and the like match the input
	  file.  This is not as good as forcing everything to UTF-8, but it
	  is better than the reported behaviour of returning Latin-1
	  strings saying they were UTF-8.  (I cannot reproduce that bug
	  despite upgrading XML::Twig and XML::Parser to the same versions;
	  I think it might be a perl 5.8 thing.)

	  This contradicts the documentation, which says the encoding will
	  always be returned as UTF-8.	At present I think that tv_cat is
	  the only filter program which will work with the new behaviour,
	  but that should be sufficient for testing.

2002-09-10 05:25  epaepa

	* filter/tv_extractinfo_en, grab/de/tv_grab_de: Fixed
	  Term::ProgressBar detection.

2002-09-10 05:24  epaepa

	* lib/XMLTV.pm.in: cat(): In an attempt to remove some magic
	  'UTF-8' strings from the source, it now just checks that the
	  encoding is the same for all the files to be concatenated (like
	  already happens for credits).

	  It looks like I'll have to remove the UTF-8 assumptions
	  altogether, this is at least a first step.

	  looking worriedly at the modem lights and thinking 'hmm, I didn't
	  know tv_grab_uk was this slow, even on a 28.8 connection and
	  P200', I have improved the status messages so there's more
	  description of what is happening.  Most important among these
	  improvements is making the progress bar detection actually work -
	  previously it wouldn't detect that Term::ProgressBar was
	  installed and would remain silent.  Also, downloading now happens
	  first of all with parsing later, so you can go offline a bit
	  sooner.

	  The real reason it took so long is that I had pressed Return to
	  get the default 'yes' answer to 'download radio listings'.  As I
	  announced on xmltv-users soon after 0.5 was released, this option
	  is stupid because the new Ananova site has hundreds of radio
	  channels.  Now you must download them individually.

2002-09-10 05:18  epaepa

	* Makefile.PL: Since CGI::Carp is responsible for making all
	  warning messages look Martian, and it's included with the CGI
	  module anyway, we can just check for CGI and not bother loading
	  CGI::Carp.

	  Switched from if (defined $@) to just if ($@), which seems to be
	  correct.

2002-09-09 18:12  epaepa

	* Makefile.PL: Loading the CGI::Carp module does strange things to
	  warn(), so use print STDERR instead.

2002-09-09 06:25  epaepa

	* lib/XMLTV.pm.in: parse_callback(), parsefile_callback(): new
	  callback-based interface for incremental reading of XMLTV files.
	  This isn't used by anything yet, and isn't thoroughly tested
	  (though it seems to work); it probably won't be used in the 0.5.1
	  release but I want to start changing the filter programs to it
	  soon afterwards.

2002-09-08 17:45  epaepa

	* MANIFEST: Adding tv_check.bat to the MANIFEST - it is not
	  installed but it is part of the source distribution.

2002-09-08 03:54  epaepa

	* lib/Ask.pm: ask(): changed to be more robust, removing leading
	  and trailing whitespace instead of chopping off the last
	  character.  This might fix Robert E.'s installation problems (I
	  think he is using Windows).

2002-09-07 14:34  epaepa

	* grab/de/tv_grab_de: Added a comment mentioning the backup server
	  for de/at listings.

2002-09-07 14:28  epaepa

	* Makefile.PL: Adding more quotation marks around hash keys, which
	  seem to be required by newer perls.  I thought => was meant to
	  count as quoting its left argument.  Oh well.

2002-09-06 21:47  rmeden

	* choose/tv_check/tv_check.bat: Sample batch file for folks using
	  the windows exe version

2002-09-06 20:59  rmeden

	* choose/tv_check/tv_check_doc.html: Updated docs for
	  --myreplaytv.com option.

2002-09-06 20:57  rmeden

	* README.tv_check, choose/tv_check/README.tv_check: Removed
	  references to excessive CPU and memory usage. Now that we use
	  XML::Twig, it doesn't appear to be a problem

2002-09-06 09:13  rmeden

	* choose/tv_check/tv_check: Misc bug fixes

2002-09-05 22:21  rmeden

	* choose/tv_check/README.tv_check, README.tv_check: README updates.
	  Also sync'd the 2 README.tv_check files.

2002-09-05 22:19  rmeden

	* choose/tv_check/tv_check: misc bug fixes mostly related to new
	  XMLTV.pm

2002-09-05 15:49  epaepa

	* Makefile.PL: Changed the setup questions so that they don't warn
	  'you will need Foo' when Foo is already installed.  If the
	  prerequisites are installed, then the default answer to the
	  installation question is 'yes'.

2002-09-05 13:04  epaepa

	* lib/XMLTV.pm.in: After each <channel> or <programme> element has
	  been read, call flush() to throw away those parts of the XML tree
	  which have been processed.

	  This gives a big reduction in memory usage.  With 0.5 a process
	  reading in a week's UK listings took 41Mbyte.  Switching to
	  XML::Twig cut that to 25Mbyte and now adding flush() takes it to
	  13Mbyte.  But I would still like to do better of course :-).

2002-09-04 21:39  rmeden

	* choose/tv_check/tv_check: added --myreplaytv option to grab info
	  from myreplaytv.com for ReplayTV owners.

2002-09-04 16:00  epaepa

	* Makefile.PL, README, grab/uk/tv_grab_uk.in: tv_grab_uk.in: use
	  XML::Twig instead of XML::DOM for parsing Ananova's weird
	  'regions' XML.  This removes the last dependency on XML::DOM.

2002-09-04 14:43  epaepa

	* Makefile.PL, README, filter/tv_to_latex, lib/XMLTV.pm.in:
	  Reimplemented the parsing code in XMLTV.pm using XML::Twig
	  instead of XML::DOM.	Thanks to Leif Van Horn for the idea,
	  although in the end I didn't use his code.  Really all that
	  needed changing were the wrapper routines like get_attrs() around
	  the DOM tree methods.  The new implementations, wrapping
	  XML::Twig, are quite a bit shorter :-).

	  The interface to the XMLTV module is just the same as before,
	  reading all the data in a big lump.  A lazy-reading interface is
	  needed to get the best out of XML::Twig, and I will implement
	  that later.  But already there is an 18% speed improvement (on
	  the test suite) from the old version.

	  I can't quite eliminate XML::DOM because it is still used by
	  tv_grab_uk to parse Ananova's weird 'regions' page.  But that
	  will be next.

	  Also fixed the installation of section 1 manual pages.

2002-09-04 10:54  epaepa

	* lib/XMLTV.pm.in: Changed one more DOM call to use the wrapper
	  routines.  This time it was getTagName(), which turns out to be
	  the same as getNodeName() and hence get_name().

2002-09-04 09:36  epaepa

	* lib/XMLTV.pm.in: Abstracted away another DOM method -
	  $n->getNodeName() becames get_name($n).

2002-09-04 09:16  epaepa

	* lib/XMLTV.pm.in: The file parsing code includes severel wrappers
	  around XML::DOM.  For example dom_attrs() returns a hashref of a
	  node's attributes, after skipping over attributes beginning with
	  'x-'.  I've changed the names of these from dom_whatever() to
	  get_whatever(), so that they can become wrappers around some
	  other library such as XML::Twig.

2002-09-03 06:27  epaepa

	* Makefile.PL, README, choose/tv_pick/tv_pick_cgi,
	  filter/tv_to_latex, grab/de/tv_grab_de: Done some more to cut
	  down on dependencies.  Now tv_pick_cgi and tv_grab_na are
	  optional in Makefile.PL, because they both have unusual
	  dependencies that aren't shared by the other programs.  I've also
	  made Unicode::String and Compress::Zlib kludgealikes, so these
	  two modules have been downgraded to 'recommended'.

	  This all needs testing.

2002-09-01 12:00  epaepa

	* lib/Ask.pm: Answers should be read from standard input and never
	  from command-line arguments...

2002-09-01 11:55  epaepa

	* MANIFEST, Makefile.PL, choose/tv_check/README.tv_check,
	  grab/Ask.pm, lib/Ask.pm: Because tv_check has dependencies on Tk
	  and Tk::TableMatrix, which the other parts of xmltv don't, I have
	  made it optional.  The Makefile.PL now asks whether you want to
	  install tv_check.  I may do the same to other parts of XMLTV if
	  they require non-standard modules.

	  This meant moving Ask.pm out of the grab/ directory (which was a
	  slightly silly place for it anyway) and into lib/, since it is
	  now used by the whole project and not just by the grabbers.  The
	  Makefile.PL loads this library 'by hand' and uses it to prompt
	  about tv_check.

	  I've also changed tv_check's README to standardize on the name
	  tv_check not TVCHECK or tvcheck... I hope it's author doesn't
	  mind too much :-(.

	  grab/uk/xmltv_ananova.dtd, lib/XMLTV.pm.in, t/parallel_test,

	  my email address.  Purged all traces of my old userid.

2002-08-30 16:35  epaepa

	* Makefile.PL: Fixed (I hope) that problem with certain MakeMaker
	  versions.  It happened because to get uninstall, I was physically
	  manipulating the generated Makefile, but some versions of
	  MakeMaker produced text slightly different to what was expected.
	  Now I hope the code is more robust.

2002-08-30 16:23  epaepa

	* Makefile.PL, README: Added Tk and Tk::TableMatrix to the list of
	  dependencies, they were missing before.

2002-08-29 14:56  epaepa

	* Makefile.PL, README, choose/tv_check/tv_check,
	  choose/tv_pick/tv_pick_cgi, filter/tv_cat,
	  filter/tv_extractinfo_en, filter/tv_grep.in, filter/tv_sort,
	  filter/tv_to_latex, grab/Ask.pm, grab/Memoize.pm,
	  grab/de/tv_grab_de, grab/uk/Ananova_Channel.pm, grab/uk/UK_TZ.pm,
	  grab/uk/tv_grab_uk.in, lib/Clumps.pm, lib/XMLTV.pm.in,
	  t/add_time_info, t/parallel_test: Well, up till now I've resisted
	  calls to trim the number of modules required by xmltv.  I said
	  the answer was not to reduce library use but rather to make it
	  easy for users to install those libraries, by providing them as
	  packages.  But after moving to a new system myself I realize that
	  this attitude was too optimistic.  Whatever the merits in
	  principle of packaging the libraries separately, in practice it
	  is a lot of effort to keep track of those dependencies.

	  As a starting point I have reduced the dependencies to packages
	  which come as standard with Linux-Mandrake 8.2.  This meant
	  removing dependencies on obscure modules (many of which I wrote
	  myself).  Some, like Tie::IxHash and Sort::Versions, turned out
	  not be used anywhere, although they were once.  Others like
	  Log::TraceMessages and Memoize can be replaced with stub routines
	  when they are not found, and there are some like
	  Lingua::Preferred where doing this gives a small loss of
	  functionality, but not anything that most users will notice.

	  On the other hand, I noticed that tv_pick.cgi requires the CGI
	  module, which had slipped through the dependency net until now
	  :-(.	At least it is a common module which will probably be
	  packaged (it is in Mandrake).

	  I've changed the Makefile.PL and README accordingly; building
	  will warn about 'recommended' modules which are missing but they
	  don't stop the Makefile being written.

	  I've run many of the altered programs on my own machine but more
	  testing is needed.

	  Also improved the 'please run --configure' message in tv_grab_uk.

2002-08-08 07:50  jveldhuis

	* grab/na/ZapListings.pm: added languages Khmer and Ojibwa

2002-06-24 17:08  rmeden

	* choose/tv_check/tv_check: Fix bug with ReplayTV conflict checker.
	  Extra episodes were not correctly being added to the conflict
	  search.

2002-06-14 10:54  jveldhuis

	* grab/na/tv_grab_na: added --list-channels to --configure command
	  line options, works similar to --list-providers.

2002-06-14 10:20  jveldhuis

	* grab/na/tv_grab_na: fixed perldoc and usage a bit

2002-06-14 10:16  jveldhuis

	* grab/na/tv_grab_na: fixed help messages that said config file
	  lands in $HOME/.tv_grab_na

2002-06-14 10:16  jveldhuis

	* grab/na/tv_grab_na: fixed help message that was a bit too long

2002-06-14 10:08  jveldhuis

	* grab/na/tv_grab_na: 1. undid Ed's Date_Init() call to explictly
	  set TZ for windows exectuables,    didn't work the way we wanted.

	  2. reordered some of the --configure help messages (more logical)

	  3. added support for using tv_grab_na to dump list of providers
	  for	 guis (such as Andy's FreeGuide) that want to reproduce the
	     configure process in a gui. Usage is:	 --configure
	  --list-providers --postalcode <code>	  or	   --configure
	  --list-providers --zipcode <code>    Output newline separated
	  list of providers ids and their descriptions..     Note: --retry
	  settings don't have any effect using --list-providers.

2002-05-29 11:29  epaepa

	* grab/na/tv_grab_na: Call Date_Init() at the start of the script,
	  to avoid timezone problems on Windows.

2002-05-29 11:25  epaepa

	* grab/uk/tv_grab_uk.in: fix_ananova_xml(): common checks for
	  broken Ananova XML output.

	  Removed dependency on Sort::Versions, it is no longer needed now
	  that the Ananova ids are purely numeric.

2002-05-29 07:21  epaepa

	* t/parallel_test: Removed fixups that were needed for transition
	  from old to new grabber.  Check that temporary directory exists.

2002-05-27 10:49  epaepa

	* README: Removed duplicate dependency.

2002-05-27 10:48  epaepa

	* README: XML::DOM depends on XML::Parser.

2002-05-27 02:54  epaepa

	* todo/TASKS.epa: Added some artefacts I noticed in the new Ananova
	  listings to the task list (ie, they should be fixed sometime).

2002-05-23 05:22  epaepa

	* mkdist: Modified mkdist to check out its working copy and build
	  tarballs in a temporary directory, _not_ ./xmltv/.  This is
	  because running mkdist in the working copy could otherwise create
	  great confusion, especially with the build process which
	  recursively looks for Makefile.PLs to execute...

2002-05-23 05:08  epaepa

	* Makefile.PL: Last-minute fix: the toplevel README is the one to
	  be installed, not the now-removed doc/README.

2002-05-23 05:02  epaepa

	* mkdist: Added my personal t/data/do_not_dist/ directory to
	  @toremove.  Hope it works.

2002-05-23 04:59  epaepa

	* MANIFEST: Updated MANIFEST with recently added and removed
	  documentation files.	(BTW, these docs need not be installed -
	  they are there as a guide to the source tree.)

2002-05-23 04:54  epaepa

	* choose/tv_check/README.tv_check: Wrapped lines to 70 columns -
	  hope you don't mind Robert.

2002-05-23 04:50  epaepa

	* analyse_tvprefs/README: Token documentation on the
	  analyse_tvprefs tool.

2002-05-23 04:47  epaepa

	* doc/code/grabber_interface: The grabber_interface file is
	  currently just a placeholder, but at least it now contains a
	  small amount of useful information.

2002-05-23 04:43  epaepa

	* doc/QuickStart: Updated to reflect that binaries will be
	  installed in the PATH and no longer just run from the current
	  directory.

2002-05-23 04:39  epaepa

	* doc/README: Removed the README from version 0.3.1 which was lying
	  around in this directory the whole time :-P.

2002-05-23 04:33  epaepa

	* lib/XMLTV.pm.in: Strip whitespace on output as well as input;
	  made it explicit that this happens.

2002-05-23 04:32  epaepa

	* filter/tv_grep.in: Added a note about the clumpidx fixing which
	  stops tv_grep being fully idempotent.

2002-05-23 04:30  epaepa

	* t/test_filters.t: Keep track of number of tests correctly
	  (including if some idempotence tests are skipped.)

	  It turns out that tv_grep is not 100% idempotent due to clumpidx
	  fixing.

2002-05-23 04:29  epaepa

	* todo/TASKS.epa: Crossed one more item off the task list.  There
	  are a few more 'todo' items which aren't on this list,
	  unfortunately.

2002-05-23 04:28  epaepa

	* README: Added a warning about that ridiculously slow test suite
	  :-).

2002-05-23 04:27  epaepa

	* README: Updated README for the real 0.5 release.

2002-05-23 03:28  epaepa

	* grab/uk/README: Wrote a quick guide to the tv_grab_uk source
	  code.

2002-05-23 03:15  epaepa

	* grab/uk/xmltv_ananova.dtd: This is the DTD used by Ananova for
	  their XMLTVish listings, included as documentation.

2002-05-23 03:13  epaepa

	* grab/de/tv_grab_de: Fix an error in the served XML pages (empty
	  <length> element).

2002-05-22 11:09  epaepa

	* grab/uk/: Ananova_Channel.pm, channel_ids, tv_grab_uk.in: This is
	  it, the new version of the UK grabber.  This fetches XML
	  documents from Ananova's server, munges them a bit and outputs
	  them.  It hasn't had quite as much testing as I would have liked,
	  but because the old listings feed stopped I have to commit this
	  now.	Also the code is not as clean as it could be, but ditto.

	  Another problem is slowness and bloatedness; it parses the XML
	  received and this means a lot of memory usage with the current
	  XMLTV.pm.  Still, on a fast machine the main bottleneck will be
	  speed of download from the server (which is very slow), so I
	  don't feel too guilty.

2002-05-22 08:29  epaepa

	* grab/uk/channel_pkgs/: arts, entertainment, film, gratis,
	  lifestyle, misc, scifi, shop, sport: Removed some dud channels
	  from the predefined packages, and updated a few more to use newer
	  ids.	(In principle the XMLTV ids are supposed never to change,
	  but...)

2002-05-21 08:32  epaepa

	* t/parallel_test: The test script I was using to compare the new
	  listings feed to the old.  It cannot be used now, but I'm
	  committing it as a record of the sort of differences between the
	  two feeds.  Many of the differences are thought to be caused by
	  the new feed being 24 hours behind; that is, it gives a week's
	  listings as before, but things like sporting events or
	  last-minute schedule alterations will be less current than in the
	  old feed.

2002-05-21 08:23  epaepa

	* grab/uk/cvt: Removed 'cvt' program to convert channel listings -
	  the job has been done.

2002-05-21 08:22  epaepa

	* grab/uk/cvt: This is the program I used to match the old listings
	  source's channel names to those used by the new listings (and so
	  generate a new file mapping XMLTV ids to Ananova ids).  It's not
	  likely to be used again, but I'm committing it for the record.

2002-05-21 08:13  epaepa

	* t/parallel_test: Adding the new 'radio4' test case.  Not that it
	  will be used for a while, because with the old feed gone it's not
	  possible to run parallel tests comparing new and old output.

2002-05-21 08:13  epaepa

	* grab/uk/: tv_grab_uk.in, test_configs/radio4: Miscellaneous
	  fixes.  These are obsolete now that the old feed has stopped (see
	  forthcoming announcement) but I'm committing them in order to not
	  lose anything.

2002-05-19 11:29  epaepa

	* grab/uk/tv_grab_uk.in, t/parallel_test: When Ananova serves a
	  freak page which doesn't have the multiple sets of listings
	  expected, retry up to 3 times.  I haven't been able to test this
	  because (typically!) as soon as I put the check in, Ananova
	  started to behave.  But at least I know it doesn't make things
	  any worse.

2002-05-18 14:17  epaepa

	* filter/tv_extractinfo_en: Fix to stop the program choking when
	  the last word of a programme description is a time.  It's still
	  not as robust as I would like, but at least this one thing is
	  fixed.

2002-05-15 09:22  epaepa

	* t/add_time_info: More helpful error message about 'funny size
	  clump' (and take a clumpidx of 0/1, ie a clump of one programme,
	  as the same as no clumpidx at all).

2002-05-15 09:21  epaepa

	* MANIFEST: Added grab/uk/test_configs/radio4 to MANIFEST.

2002-05-15 09:20  epaepa

	* grab/uk/test_configs/radio4: A new test configuration for
	  tv_grab_uk - just Radio 4.  This channel is interesting because
	  it has 'LW' and 'FM' variants.

2002-05-15 05:09  epaepa

	* t/add_time_info: Fixed an off-by-one bug - I don't know how it
	  remained undetected for so long.

2002-05-13 11:29  epaepa

	* grab/uk/Ananova_Channel.pm, grab/uk/channel_ids,
	  grab/uk/tv_grab_uk.in, t/parallel_test: tv_grab_uk: added code to
	  split Radio 4 into LW and FM variants, and a few other stations
	  into MW and FM variants.  After some experiments, it turns out
	  the only sensible way to do this is to specify it in the
	  channel_ids file, since it cannot be detected automatically
	  without grabbing a whole week's listings in advance.

	  So now we have fm.radio-4.bbc.co.uk and lw.radio-4.bbc.co.uk.
	  Unfortunately, individual channel selection still works on
	  Ananova id, and these two channels have the same Ananova id, so
	  it's not possible to download one without the other.	But this is
	  good enough.

	  Also committing the parallel_test script used to verify that this
	  change didn't break anything (I hope).

2002-05-13 06:48  epaepa

	* t/test_filters.t: Added an idempotence check for most filter
	  programs.  This checks that running the same filter twice on some
	  input is equivalent to running it once.  Unfortunately, this did
	  not catch the bug I was hoping to find - but at least the check
	  is in there now.

	  The number of tests is now 350 - this is getting really out of
	  hand.  I need to find some easy way to run just a few tests.
	  Probably by defining separate 'basic' and 'full' sets of commands
	  and example inputs.

2002-05-13 05:48  epaepa

	* lib/Clumps.pm: Downgraded a fatal 'programmes do not sort' error
	  to a warning.  This makes things like tv_grep more tolerant of
	  slightly deviant (syntactically correct but nonsensical in some
	  way) input files.

2002-05-12 08:34  epaepa

	* filter/tv_sort: Fixed bug identified earlier - not eliminating
	  duplicate programmes with no stop time.  Now overlap() returns
	  true for two programmes starting at the same time on the same
	  channel with same clumpidx, regardless of whether they have stop
	  times.  This will break if zero-length programmes come up, but
	  I'm assuming that can't happen.

2002-05-10 09:03  epaepa

	* t/data/: dups.xml, tv_cat_dups_xml.expected,
	  tv_extractinfo_en_dups_xml.expected, tv_grep_a_dups_xml.expected,
	  tv_grep_on_after_2002_02_05_dups_xml.expected,
	  tv_sort_by_channel_dups_xml.expected, tv_sort_dups_xml.expected,
	  tv_to_latex_dups_xml.expected: Noticed a bug in tv_sort where not
	  all duplicate programmes are weeded out.  These updated test
	  cases give the expected behaviour.

2002-05-08 07:55  epaepa

	* grab/uk/Ananova_Channel.pm: clone(): whoops, forgot to bless the
	  new object into a class.  That'll teach me for committing
	  untested code.

2002-05-06 11:37  epaepa

	* grab/uk/Ananova_Channel.pm: del(): new method to 'delete' a
	  channel object.

2002-05-06 11:22  epaepa

	* grab/uk/Ananova_Channel.pm: Added an accesor to remove (unset)
	  the additional display names for a channel object.  This is all
	  getting really baroque, I would like to eliminate all this
	  pointless OO stuff soon.

2002-05-06 11:19  epaepa

	* grab/uk/Ananova_Channel.pm: Removed requirement that the main
	  display name is immutable once set.  It all made sense at one
	  point but the original, very strict design isn't really being
	  followed any more.

2002-05-06 11:14  epaepa

	* grab/uk/Ananova_Channel.pm: Added a clone() method which copies
	  all information except the unique ids.

2002-05-06 10:53  epaepa

	* t/add_time_info: Don't collapse and die when a channel which
	  occurs in the less-detailed listings does not occur at all in the
	  more-detailed ones.  Instead just warn once and then leave alone
	  all programmes on that channel.

2002-05-06 04:52  epaepa

	* t/add_time_info: Added some more assertions and more detailed
	  error messages.

2002-05-05 22:59  rmeden

	* choose/tv_check/tv_check: Correction to special Replay-TV fuzzy
	  logic.  Don't look for conflicts for a "close" episode when
	  another episode exists at the proper time.

2002-05-02 09:02  epaepa

	* MANIFEST: Updated the MANIFEST for some files I added a while ago
	  (should have done it before).

2002-05-02 08:58  epaepa

	* t/test_filters.t: 'Transparently' gunzip files before running the
	  test, and gzip them back again.  This is a bit pointless at
	  present because gzipping saves only about 0.2Mbyte of space - but
	  hey, I was running out of quota.  If you don't have the files
	  gzipped then things are as before.  The test files in CVS will
	  remain uncompressed.	So you can just ignore this change :-).

2002-05-02 06:16  epaepa

	* grab/uk/tv_grab_uk.in: More elaborate workarounds for when
	  Ananova's dates are wrong.  If we fetch a file from the server
	  and its date is wrong, attempt to compensate by fetching a
	  different file which is expected to have the right date.  Unless
	  that is also bad, in which case pick another...

	  Whether all this is needed depends on the state of Ananova's
	  data.  Yesterday it was pretty much essential but today only one
	  channel is affected.

2002-05-02 06:12  epaepa

	* t/add_time_info: add_time_info is a small filter to help with
	  diffing one XMLTV file against another.  Sometimes two files
	  describe the same schedule, but one with more detail than the
	  other.  For example A may say '10:00 0/2 News; 10:00 1/2 Weather'
	  while B says '10:00 News, 10:30 Weather'.  This filter reads the
	  more detailed schedule info from B and uses it to output an
	  improved version of A.  You can then diff this output against B
	  to see if there are any differences _other than_ an increase in
	  schedule detail.  (If A's schedule is not a less detailed version
	  of B's, then add_time_info dies with an error.)

	  Not currently used for anything, but will be used for testing the
	  rewritten Ananova grabber against the old one.

2002-05-01 16:25  jveldhuis

	* grab/na/ZapListings.pm: more fixes

2002-05-01 16:12  jveldhuis

	* grab/na/ZapListings.pm: zap2it decided to drop some of the
	  spacing around () details.

2002-05-01 11:47  epaepa

	* grab/uk/tv_grab_uk.in, t/parallel_test: page_date_diff(): the new
	  name for check_page_date().  It now returns an integer, the
	  number of days by which the found date differs from the expected
	  date - or undef if something is very wrong.  The kludgy
	  manipulation of the expected date is as before.  This new version
	  doesn't behave any differently; next I will add some code to cope
	  with the latest Ananova weirdness.

2002-04-28 22:37  rmeden

	* choose/tv_check/tv_check: Changed "neartime" threshnold to from 3
	  hours to 2.  This prevents a 2300 show syndicated show from
	  matching a 2100.  I doubt anyone uses neartime anyway. :)

2002-04-26 14:31  jveldhuis

	* grab/na/ZapListings.pm: page failures now include http failure

2002-04-26 10:02  epaepa

2002-04-25 14:03  epaepa

	* filter/tv_grep.PL: Documentation fix for tv_grep and new
	  'with-lang-or-empty' handler type.  Forgot to commit it earlier.

2002-04-23 09:36  epaepa

	* grab/uk/tv_grab_uk.in: Relaxed sanity check on Ananova's
	  pointless DAYTIME, EVENING, LATENIGHT classification.

2002-04-23 09:05  epaepa

	* filter/tv_extractinfo_en: multipart_split_desc(): an exclamation
	  mark does not mark the boundary between title and subtitle as
	  previously thought, but shows the end of the title.  So it is
	  like question mark and full stop, and the behaviour of all three
	  has been made the same.  Except that while full stops are
	  stripped from the end of titles, ? and ! are not.

	  special_teletext_subtitles(): new handler to remove '(T)' from
	  the end of programme descriptions, it signifies teletext
	  subtitling.

	  Avoided outputting empty descriptions, titles etc: after a
	  regular expression has removed some text from one of these, it is
	  removed if blank.  (New subroutine scrub_empty().)

2002-04-23 08:56  epaepa

	* filter/tv_grep.in, lib/XMLTV.pm.in, t/test_filters.t,

	  t/data/tv_grep_premiere_x_whatever_xml.expected,
	  t/data/tv_sort_by_channel_test_xml.expected,
	  t/data/tv_sort_test_xml.expected: Started to distinguish between
	  elements like <title>, which always have to have some
	  human-readable content, and those like <premiere>, which may have
	  an 'explanation' inside but do not require it.  The former have
	  handler 'with-lang', the latter now 'with-lang-or-empty' which
	  can return [] for an empty element.  Trying to write out
	  inappropriate empty content (like <title></title>) will now give
	  a warning.

	  Updated tv_grep to cope with this: it is still necessary to give
	  a regular expression as the argument to predicates like
	  --premiere, but a regexp of '' will match all <premiere>
	  elements, even empty ones.  So the old behaviour is preserved.
	  Added some new test cases for this (not complete coverage though)
	  and an example of <last-chance> to test.xml.

2002-04-22 15:02  jveldhuis

	* grab/na/tv_grab_na: now verifies that all things in resulting
	  prog details gets explicitly ignored or outputed - use
	  --debuglistings to enable

2002-04-22 15:01  jveldhuis

	* grab/na/ZapListings.pm: multiple details appearing in () may not
	  get to output xml

2002-04-20 12:22  epaepa

	* filter/tv_extractinfo_en: multipart_split_desc(): an exclamation
	  mark _always_ indicates the end of the title and start of the
	  description.	Titles ending in ! are not followed by a colon.

2002-04-20 11:28  epaepa

	* grab/uk/tv_grab_uk.in: Code tidy to comply with perlstyle(1)'s
	  suggestion: 'uncuddled elses'.

2002-04-20 11:27  epaepa

	* filter/tv_extractinfo_en, lib/XMLTV.pm.in: Code tidy to conform

2002-04-20 11:22  epaepa

	* filter/tv_grep.in: Use the XMLTV::Clumps module to make sure that
	  when only some of the programmes sharing a clump are included in
	  the output, the clumpidx information is updated accordingly.

2002-04-20 11:22  epaepa

	* lib/Clumps.pm: Added support for deleting a programme sharing a
	  clump - fix_clumps() should now have complete functionality.

2002-04-20 10:57  epaepa

	* lib/Clumps.pm: Whoops - forgot to load Tie::RefHash.

2002-04-20 10:49  epaepa

	  tv_grep ought to update clumpidxes when removing programmes from
	  a clump.  These new test cases expect that behaviour.

2002-04-20 10:25  epaepa

	* MANIFEST, Makefile.PL, filter/tv_extractinfo_en, lib/Clumps.pm:
	  Refactored the fix_clumps() routine and its support routines into
	  a new module XMLTV::Clumps.  This doesn't diminish the ugliness
	  but it does at least get it out of the way.  I want to call
	  fix_clumps() from other tools than tv_extractinfo_en - it's what
	  you have to do whenever you delete / split / update a programme
	  which shares a timeslot with others.

	  All this underlines the need to get rid of clumpidx and replace
	  it with something cleaner, but that will wait until after 0.5.

2002-04-20 10:22  epaepa

	* lib/TZ.pm: Just noticed no '1;' true-returning statement at the
	  end of this module.  It seems to have managed okay withoutit so
	  far, but it's good style to add one.

2002-04-20 09:26  epaepa

	* filter/tv_extractinfo_en: fix_clumps(): Work when a programme has
	  been 'split' into one different programme.  Previously this case
	  was not handled, but I see no reason why the existing code for 2
	  or more shouldn't work with 1.  Also try to preserve the original
	  timezone when setting date strings.

2002-04-20 08:46  epaepa

	* filter/tv_extractinfo_en: Added an undocumented option
	  --no-create-sub-titles which affects the behaviour of
	  special_multipart(), making it create titles with colons in
	  rather than splitting into title and sub-title.

	  Recognize 'sports' as well as 'sport' as a category keyword.

2002-04-20 07:53  epaepa

	* filter/tv_extractinfo_en: special_multipart(): normally, the
	  heuristic is that a programme must have at least three valid
	  'times' included in its description to be considered a multipart.
	  But if the first word of the description is a time, waive that
	  requirement.

2002-04-20 07:37  epaepa

	* filter/tv_extractinfo_en: special_multipart: match categories
	  containing 'childrens' as well as 'children'.

2002-04-20 07:25  epaepa

	* filter/tv_extractinfo_en: special_multipart(): modified the
	  category checking to look for words as substrings rather than
	  simple string equality.  This is needed for the new Ananova
	  listings which have categories like 'Children's Programmes'
	  instead of 'children', for example.

2002-04-20 06:16  epaepa

	  <credits>, <video> and <audio>.  If these keys exist in the
	  programme hash but don't contain anything, then do not write
	  them.

	  This makes things look nice if (for example) you delete all the
	  actors from the 'credits' subhash.  When writing out, there will
	  not be a useless empty <credits /> element.

2002-04-20 05:30  epaepa

	* filter/tv_extractinfo_en: special_multipart(): the 'base day'

	* filter/tv_extractinfo_en: Remove trailing full stop when
	  'Introduced by...' is a sentence.

2002-04-20 04:48  epaepa

	* filter/tv_extractinfo_en: Made the multipart programme splitting
	  code take account of timezones.

2002-04-19 14:43  epaepa

	* filter/tv_extractinfo_en,
	  t/data/tv_extractinfo_en_sort_xml.expected: Added a handler for
	  the words like 'Thriller' or 'Drama' that appear at the end of
	  programme descriptions.  These are converted into categories.
	  Also made the 'news' detector add to the list of existing
	  categories, rather than doing nothing if categories already
	  exist.

2002-04-19 11:39  epaepa

	* filter/tv_extractinfo_en: Added a handler for the 'TVM' that
	  appears at the front of descriptions in old-style Ananova
	  listings, I think it stands for 'TV movie'.

2002-04-19 10:07  epaepa

	* grab/uk/tv_grab_uk.in: Stopped translating the 'new' flag to <new
	  /> in XML, that's not what it means.

2002-04-19 09:25  epaepa

	* filter/tv_extractinfo_en: Added a handler to parse out a year at
	  the start of the description and put it in <date>.

2002-04-19 08:07  jveldhuis

	* grab/na/ZapListings.pm: cleaner identification of french part x

	  at least some

2002-04-18 12:37  epaepa

	* filter/tv_extractinfo_en: Bug fix for newly added
	  special_new_series().

2002-04-18 12:00  epaepa

	* filter/tv_extractinfo_en: Added a handler for 'New series' text
	  in programme descriptions.

2002-04-18 11:06  epaepa

	* xmltv.dtd: Clarified the meaning of the 'new' element.  The old
	  UK grabber was getting it wrong.

2002-04-18 04:48  epaepa

	* grab/uk/tv_grab_uk.in: Fixed incorrect episode-num content.  The

	  the DTD to something less confusing.

2002-04-07 18:30  epaepa

	* grab/uk/tv_grab_uk.in: Added code to notice when Ananova is
	  running one day behind (which happens for example for a short
	  time after midnight) and cope without too much complaining.
	  Fixed warnings when using newer XMLTV.pm versions.

2002-03-31 16:42  epaepa

	* lib/XMLTV.pm.in: Added some trace and debugging code; made the
	  'exactly one' multiplicity specifier for parsing match what the
	  documentation says; in parse(), sanity-check for something that
	  looks like XMLTV before firing up the DOM.

2002-03-31 16:40  epaepa

	* choose/tv_pick/tv_pick_cgi: The 'date' element of a programme
	  hash is a single value if present, it's not multivalued.  Hard to
	  believe that this bug went unnoticed until now - obviously the
	  listings I use just don't have dates.

2002-03-30 08:56  epaepa

	* lib/: XMLTV.pm.PL, XMLTV.pm.in: Fixes to the POD documentation so
	  it formats correctly.  There are still some problems with the
	  formatting of the lists of handlers, which mystify me at the
	  moment.  Never mind, I don't expect many people to actually read
	  this documentation as it stands.

2002-03-30 08:38  epaepa

	* lib/XMLTV.pm.in: Made %Handlers into a global variable so that
	  it's possible (when absolutely necessary) for users to mess
	  around with the tables of parsing and writing routines, so they
	  can add their own extensions to the file format.

2002-03-30 08:29  epaepa

	* lib/XMLTV.pm.in: Make sure Emacs knows this is a Perl file.

2002-03-30 06:38  epaepa

	* grab/de/tv_grab_de: The listings have moved to a new site and
	  most of the problems have been fixed.  This grabber is looking

	* MANIFEST, Makefile.PL, filter/tv_grep.PL, filter/tv_grep.in,
	  lib/XMLTV.pm, lib/XMLTV.pm.PL, lib/XMLTV.pm.in: Added pod
	  documentation to XMLTV.pm.  As with tv_grep, part of it is
	  automatically generated from the list of 'handlers' for
	  subelements of <programme> and <channel>.  This necessitated
	  moving XMLTV.pm to XMLTV.pm.in and writing a short script
	  XMLTV.pm.PL to generate the end file.

	  Also I needed to change the way the list of handlers is stored -
	  now they're looked up by a string rather than being subroutine
	  references.  This is so we can also use the strings in the pod
	  documentation :-).  The function list_programme_keys() has been
	  changed to just return the list of handlers (more or less), which
	  has meant changing tv_grep.  Found and fixed a bug in tv_grep in
	  the meantime, and made a small change to XMLTV.pm's handling of
	  subtitles.  Apart from those fixes and any new bugs introduced,
	  the behaviour should be the same - just we now have some rather
	  pedantic half-auto-generated documentation as well.

	* t/data/: test.xml, tv_cat_test_xml.expected,

	  tv_grep_eval_scalar_keys_5_test_xml.expected,
	  tv_sort_by_channel_test_xml.expected, tv_sort_test_xml.expected:
	  Noticed that test.xml didn't have anything for subtitles, added
	  it and modified the expected outputs accordingly.  (This doesn't
	  quite match the current version of XMLTV.pm, but it matches the
	  one I'm about to commit.)

	  bug in tv_grep (while making the changes I'm about to commit
	  next), it wasn't caught by the test suite because the test suite
	  itself was wrong (I didn't check the expected results thoroughly
	  enough).  Fixed that, and added another test.

2002-03-16 11:39  epaepa

	* t/test_filters.t: When a test fails to create its output file, it
	  'fails' but the test suite continues.

2002-03-16 09:02  jveldhuis

	* grab/na/tv_grab_na: improved retry message - I have no idea what
	  I was thinking :)

2002-03-15 12:08  epaepa

	* grab/uk/tv_grab_uk.in: Print copyright message to stderr on
	  download, as requested by Ananova.

2002-03-15 11:54  epaepa

	* grab/uk/: Ananova_Channel.pm, channel_ids, tv_grab_uk.in: New
	  version (though not a full rewrite) of the UK grabber.  This uses
	  the new show=allchannels channel listing on the website, which
	  eliminates a lot of the hassle with 'definitive' versus
	  'tentative' channel names, terrestrial channels not listed, and
	  so on.  On the downside there is no longer any way to distinguish
	  radio and satellite channels, the grabber guesses that based on
	  the name.

2002-03-15 11:51  epaepa

	* MANIFEST: Forgot to add the new test files for tv_sort
	  --by-channel to the MANIFEST.

2002-03-15 11:50  epaepa

	* t/parallel_test: The fixup commands can now be applied to both
	  the old output and the new output independently, and can be a
	  list of commands rather than just one or zero.  Added new flags
	  -a (reuse output from old version) and -b (reuse output from new
	  version), together these replace the -q (quick) flag.

2002-03-15 11:47  epaepa

	* grab/Memoize.pm: Behave correctly when --cache is last argument.

2002-03-15 11:47  epaepa

	* xmltv.dtd: Formatting change for the sake of dtd2latex.

2002-03-15 09:12  epaepa

2002-03-15 02:30  epaepa

	* attic/rcs.tar: Removing the old RCS archive, it won't be needed
	  now.	It's still in CVS somewhere of course, just now it won't be
	  checked out.

2002-03-13 03:15  epaepa

	* todo/TASKS.epa: Another DTD feature request.	Ouch, there will be
	  a lot to do once 0.5 is out.

2002-03-12 10:14  jveldhuis

	* grab/na/ZapListings.pm: cleaned up program details only to scrape
	  the ones in parenthesis

2002-03-11 16:48  jveldhuis

	* grab/na/ZapListings.pm: now identified languages with / and -
	  separators

2002-03-11 16:46  jveldhuis

	* grab/na/tv_grab_na: fixed minor bugs - thanks Brian

2002-03-11 14:47  jveldhuis

	* grab/na/tv_grab_na: fixed --retry-limit rename problem :)

2002-03-11 13:00  jveldhuis

	* grab/na/tv_grab_na: slight warning message change

2002-03-11 12:58  jveldhuis

	* grab/na/tv_grab_na: added retry limits and retry delays in
	  configure and command line options

2002-03-10 04:28  epaepa

	* t/test_filters.t: The 'make test' code no longer uses diff(1), it
	  compares the contents of two files purely in Perl.

2002-03-10 04:16  epaepa

	* Makefile.PL: Don't run 'fixin' on documentation and share files -
	  it's intended for Perl scripts only, to run things like pl2bat!

2002-03-09 11:51  epaepa

	* Makefile.PL: Kinder, gentler error messages for missing
	  dependencies.  I will make a feature-request or patch against
	  MakeMaker to do the same thing, but for the time being the code
	  needs to be in Makefile.PL.

2002-03-07 06:57  epaepa

	* Makefile.PL, choose/tv_check/tv_check, filter/tv_cat,
	  filter/tv_extractinfo_en, filter/tv_grep.in, filter/tv_sort,
	  filter/tv_to_latex, grab/de/tv_grab_de, grab/uk/tv_grab_uk.in,
	  t/test_filters.t: Got rid of most of the usage() subroutines in
	  favour of XMLTV::Usage.  It seems to work okay, unless I made a
	  typing error.  Also realized I had forgotten to include tv_check
	  in the list of binaries.

2002-03-07 06:38  epaepa

	* MANIFEST, Makefile.PL, lib/Usage.pm: Added a new library
	  XMLTV::Usage to save on ten identical usage() subroutines.  The
	  next change will start using it.

2002-03-07 06:17  epaepa

	* filter/tv_cat, filter/tv_extractinfo_en, filter/tv_sort,
	  filter/tv_to_latex, grab/de/tv_grab_de, grab/uk/tv_grab_uk.in,
	  t/test_filters.t: Made sure that failure of GetOptions() is
	  caught and triggers a usage message (and unsuccessful exit).	I
	  had omitted to do this before now.

2002-03-07 06:09  epaepa

	* grab/uk/tv_grab_uk.in: Fixed usage message properly (I hope).

2002-03-07 06:01  epaepa

	* grab/uk/tv_grab_uk.in: Added a usage message (dealt with FIXME).

2002-03-07 05:57  epaepa

	* README: Updated README for 0.5pre2.

2002-03-07 05:53  epaepa

	  DTD says they should not.  It doesn't look as pretty now :-(.

2002-03-07 05:20  epaepa

	* grab/uk/tv_grab_uk.in, todo/TASKS.epa: Whoops, messed up the
	  module inclusion for tv_grab_uk.  I fixed this once but edited
	  the generated file rather than the source tv_grab_uk.in (d'oh!).

	  Marked a few more tasks as 'done'.

2002-03-07 05:16  epaepa

	* doc/QuickStart: Unified the grabber QuickStart instructions, they
	  are quite similar now.

2002-03-07 04:53  epaepa

	* MANIFEST, Makefile.PL, Uninstall.pm: Hacked together an
	  'uninstall' target.  It removes files created by 'make install'.
	  However it does not remove empty directories, and leaves the
	  packlist and perllocal.pod files alone.  (These files are
	  _modified_ in strange ways on installation, it's hard to unmodify
	  them.)

2002-03-07 04:42  epaepa

	* grab/uk/tv_grab_uk.in: Whoops, forgot to import the gettz()
	  function.  I'm trying to move away from export-by-default
	  (@EXPORT) towards export-if-asked (@EXPORT_OK).

2002-03-07 04:40  epaepa

	* todo/TASKS.epa: Added a few more todo items, almost all for
	  tv_extractinfo_en.  That tool can suck almost infinite amounts of
	  programmer time.  I noticed these after beginning to get radio
	  listings as well as television.

2002-03-07 04:39  epaepa

	* filter/tv_extractinfo_en: Reinstated the timezone preservation in
	  time12to24(), I think I removed it by accident.  Doesn't seem to
	  make any difference :-).

2002-03-06 10:20  epaepa

	* filter/tv_extractinfo_en, filter/tv_grep.in, filter/tv_sort,
	  filter/tv_to_latex, grab/uk/UK_TZ.pm, lib/TZ.pm: The DTD says
	  quite clearly 'if no explicit timezone is given, UT is assumed'.
	  But until now that's not what the various tools were doing: they
	  were interpreting plain dates according to the local timezone.
	  Jerry spotted this by running 'make test'; the tv_to_latex output
	  was wrong.

	  I've fixed most of the programs to have Date_Init('TZ=UT').  The
	  external timezone should not affect the output of filter programs
	  (it should depend only on the input) so this is the right thing
	  for those.  For tv_grab_de TZ=CET is assumed.  But I haven't
	  changed tv_grab_na or tv_choose because I didn't want to risk
	  breaking them.  They do need checking though.

	  One nice side-effect of calling Date_Init() in every program is
	  that the Windows timezone error will go away.

2002-03-06 10:12  epaepa

	* MANIFEST.SKIP: Whoops, regexp confusion.

2002-03-06 10:11  epaepa

	* MANIFEST.SKIP: Skip warning about the '*.orig' backup files
	  generated by patch(1).

2002-03-06 09:11  epaepa

	* MANIFEST, Makefile.PL, XMLTV.pm, lib/XMLTV.pm: Moved XMLTV.pm
	  into the lib/ directory along with TZ.pm.  So now lib/ is the
	  place for modules needed by the rest of the project (as distinct
	  from modules needed only for a particular program, which can live
	  in that program's own directory).  This is ad hoc, but tidier
	  than before.

2002-03-06 09:01  epaepa

	* MANIFEST, Makefile.PL, XMLTV.pm, filter/tv_to_latex,
	  grab/uk/UK_TZ.pm, lib/TZ.pm: Created a new XMLTV::TZ module for
	  the two timezone-handling routines gettz() and
	  ParseDate_PreservingTZ().  So now the general timezone stuff is
	  in XMLTV::TZ and the UK-specific summer time stuff is in
	  XMLTV::UK_TZ.

2002-03-06 08:36  epaepa

	* t/test_filters.t: Formatting change.

2002-03-06 08:36  epaepa

	* t/test_filters.t: Redirect stderr to a file which is removed if
	  the test passes.

2002-03-06 06:06  epaepa

	* grab/na/tv_grab_na: Created manual page, and changed --config
	  option to --config-file.

2002-03-06 06:03  epaepa

	* grab/Ask.pm: Fixed the regexp match of $res by quoting with
	  \Q...\E.  Otherwise strange characters in the user response cause
	  the regexp to do strange things.

2002-03-06 05:03  epaepa

	* grab/uk/tv_grab_uk.in: Manual page for tv_grab_uk.

2002-03-05 16:07  jveldhuis

	* grab/na/ZapListings.pm: added a couple languages and relaxed the
	  requirements on there names

2002-03-04 11:35  epaepa

	* MANIFEST, grab/uk/tv_grab_uk.in, grab/uk/test_configs/all,

	  grab/uk/test_configs/radio, grab/uk/test_configs/satellite,
	  grab/uk/test_configs/tynetees, t/parallel_test: Using tv_grab_uk
	  is now more like tv_grab_na: there's a separate --configure stage
	  where you choose what channels to download.  This is slightly
	  less flexible than the old command line arguments, and I still
	  have to work out a decent system for prompting the user about new
	  channels that have appeared on the site.  But it should make
	  things more user-friendly and consistent.

	  For the benefit of testing (parallel_test) there's a
	  --config-file argument and a set of sample configs.

2002-03-04 10:02  epaepa

	* grab/na/tv_grab_na: Display the providers to the user in the same
	  order as the website (as it was before).

2002-03-04 09:28  epaepa

	* grab/: Ask.pm, uk/tv_grab_uk.in: Finished writing the --configure
	  routine for tv_grab_uk.  All I have to do now is actually read
	  the configuration file when it runs :-).  To handle long runs of
	  yes/no with optional 'yes to all' I added
	  XMLTV::Ask::askManyBooleanQuestions().  I have not yet modified
	  tv_grab_na to use this routine although it would probably be a
	  good idea for tidyness.

	  Also added some (mostly futile) error checking and recovery to
	  tv_grab_uk.  This happened when I was tracking down a date error:
	  it turns out that Ananova rotate their pages at some unspecified
	  time after midnight, so tv_grab_uk needs to compensate.  This
	  isn't yet done.

2002-03-04 09:17  epaepa

	* MANIFEST.SKIP: Skip warning about XMLTV::Memoize's *.cache files.

2002-03-04 07:54  epaepa

	* grab/: Ask.pm, na/tv_grab_na: Removed the unvalidated questions
	  from XMLTV::Ask, now the response must always be in the list of
	  options (as must the default).  The provider selection in
	  tv_grab_na now uses askQuestion() rather than printing out
	  options by itself.

2002-03-04 03:15  epaepa

	* grab/Memoize.pm: Fixed argument parsing so eg --cache --configure
	  is treated as two separate options.

2002-03-01 14:14  jveldhuis

	* grab/na/tv_grab_na: added warning on grab that config file
	  location needs upgrading

2002-03-01 14:09  jveldhuis

	* grab/na/tv_grab_na: now on --configure, configuration file moved
	  to new location ie from ~/.xmltv_na to ~/xmltv/tv_grab_na

	  fixed all calls to Ask.pm subroutines, poorly separated :<

2002-03-01 14:07  jveldhuis

	* grab/Ask.pm: fixed it because it was obviously not tested

2002-02-28 11:51  jveldhuis

	* grab/na/ZapListings.pm: added a couple of new languages I have
	  come across

2002-02-28 11:03  epaepa

	* grab/Ask.pm, grab/uk/tv_grab_uk.in, t/parallel_test: *Started* to
	  implement --configure for tv_grab_uk.  This means moving the
	  existing 'main program' into a grab() subroutine and then calling
	  either grab() or configure() depending on the command line.  The
	  --configure option doesn't work yet, but tv_grab_uk is no worse
	  than it was before and passes the test suite (parallel_test), so
	  now is a good interim time to commit before I mess it up further.

	  Made the askMyQuestion() routine in XMLTV::Ask notice when there
	  are a long-winded set of options and present them as multiple
	  choice with numbers.	So you can use this single routine for both
	  short and long questions.

2002-02-28 06:50  epaepa

	* MANIFEST.SKIP: 'make distcheck' doesn't warn about Emacs autosave
	  files.

2002-02-28 06:48  epaepa

	* MANIFEST, Makefile.PL, grab/Ask.pm, grab/na/tv_grab_na: Moved the
	  question-asking routines from the --configure stage of tv_grab_na
	  to a new support module XMLTV::Ask.

2002-02-28 05:19  epaepa

	* grab/Memoize.pm: Fixed the choice of cache filename when --cache
	  is given to a program that calls XMLTV::Memoize::check_argv().
	  It should be in the current directory, not the same directory as
	  the binary!

2002-02-28 05:15  epaepa

	* MANIFEST, MANIFEST.SKIP, Makefile.PL, mkdist,
	  grab/uk/tv_grab_uk.in, grab/uk/channel_pkgs/adult,

	  grab/uk/channel_pkgs/travel: Moved out the rest of tv_grab_uk's
	  channel data into files installed in share/.	This isn't ideal,
	  there should be a way for users to override them or create new
	  channel packages with files in their home directory, but that
	  will come later.

	  Made sure that 'make distclean' works properly.  It doesn't
	  remove the files removed by mkdist, but apart from that should
	  check that the working copy is prepared for distribution.  (Also
	  do 'cvs -q update -Pd' to check there are no files left to check
	  in.)

2002-02-28 05:12  epaepa

	* mkdist: Modified the list of files and directories to remove.  A
	  single list is sufficient, and now if the files are missing
	  anyway they're just ignored.	This will be handy when testing new
	  additions to the distribution.

2002-02-28 05:02  epaepa

	* README: updated version to XMLTV test

2002-02-27 11:10  epaepa

	* Makefile.PL, grab/uk/channel_ids, grab/uk/tv_grab_uk,
	  grab/uk/tv_grab_uk.PL, grab/uk/tv_grab_uk.in, t/parallel_test:
	  Begun the process of moving the hardcoded channel data out of
	  tv_grab_uk and into text files.  To start with I have put the big
	  list mapping Ananova ids to XMLTV ids into its own file, which
	  lives in the share/ directory (eg /usr/local/share/).  This meant
	  altering Makefile.PL to support 'share' files in the same way it
	  was already altered for 'docs', and processing tv_grab_uk on
	  installation to set the path to the data file.

	  One side effect of the new way of loading the data is that the
	  channel 'BBC1' now maps to generic BBC1 rather than the BBC1 West
	  it was before (for some reason).  This is probably because I
	  reordered the Ananova ids in the channel_ids file.  But that
	  looks like a good side effect.

2002-02-27 10:50  epaepa

	* mkdist: Commented out version number number check to allow
	  numbers like '0.5pre1'.

2002-02-25 10:27  epaepa

	* README: Updated README for 0.5pre1, a testing release I'm about
	  to make.

	  anyway.

	  (I plan to slim down 'make test' a bit so it doesn't grow
	  linearly with both the number of filters and number of test
	  cases.)

2002-02-25 09:53  epaepa

	  tv_grab_de.  I plan to split up the dependencies a bit soon.

2002-02-25 09:49  epaepa

	* doc/QuickStart: Added mention of tv_grab_de, although I still
	  don't know exactly what country(s) it corresponds to.

2002-02-24 12:54  epaepa

	* MANIFEST, Makefile.PL, grab/de/tv_grab_de: Yay, another grabber!
	  This time for Germany and Austria.

	  Actually I tell a lie - this is just fetching the XML files which
	  Goofy makes available from his database.  The service resumed
	  recently.  But now we have a standard way to get listings rather
	  than telling users 'go and download these files by hand'.

2002-02-24 12:52  epaepa

	  with XMLTV::parsefile(), which reads from a filename or URL, and
	  XMLTV::parse(), which reads XML straight from a string.  This is
	  the same interface as XML::DOM.  write_data() has not changed
	  because I couldn't think of a better name.

2002-02-24 11:59  epaepa

	* grab/: na/tv_grab_na, uk/tv_grab_uk: Changed tv_grab_na's version
	  number checking to use the date rather than the CVS id.  The date
	  is guaranteed to increase monotonically for any given development
	  branch, so this should mean we don't have to mess with CVS in
	  future.

	  Added a check that --days isn't negative to both grabbers - it
	  can't hurt :-).

2002-02-24 11:34  epaepa

	* MANIFEST, Makefile.PL, grab/Memoize.pm, grab/uk/tv_grab_uk: Moved
	  the code for the undocumented --cache option from tv_grab_uk into
	  a new module XMLTV::Memoize.	Then caching should be fairly easy
	  to add to new grabbers.

2002-02-24 11:33  epaepa

	* t/parallel_test: Modified to work with the blib/ setup.  It is
	  still specific to my directory structure but should be easy to
	  change for yours.

2002-02-24 10:51  epaepa

	* XMLTV/: Ananova_Channel.pm, UK_TZ.pm, ZapListings.pm: Removing
	  old copies of Perl modules, they have moved to new homes.

2002-02-24 10:22  epaepa

	* XMLTV.pm, filter/tv_cat: Made tv_cat into a library function,
	  XMLTV::cat().  This is because the forthcoming tv_grab_de will
	  use it too.  I was thinking of making tv_grab_de as a shell
	  script running wget and tv_cat, which would be cool, but I like
	  Perl too much.

2002-02-24 10:20  epaepa

	* t/test_filters.t: Fixed test_filters so it doesn't chdir().  It
	  can't do that because the @INC path is set relative to the
	  current directory ('blib/lib' and others).  Previously it was
	  working by accident, picking up XMLTV.pm and stuff installed
	  elsewhere.

2002-02-24 10:18  epaepa

	* t/data/: simple.xml, tv_cat_simple_xml.expected,
	  tv_extractinfo_en_simple_xml.expected,

	  tv_grep_on_after_2002_02_05_simple_xml.expected,
	  tv_sort_simple_xml.expected, tv_to_latex_simple_xml.expected: I
	  wrote an example XMLTV file to add to the web page, and thought
	  it might as well go into the test suite too.	It would be rather
	  embarassing if the software stopped handling the example on the
	  web page...

2002-02-24 07:18  epaepa

	* filter/: tv_cat, tv_extractinfo_en, tv_grep.in, tv_sort,
	  tv_to_latex: Finished writing the manual pages for the filters.
	  Not bothering to document the --help option, it should be obvious
	  and GNU grep's manpage doesn't.

2002-02-23 11:41  epaepa

	* MANIFEST, Makefile.PL, filter/tv_extractinfo_en, filter/tv_grep,
	  filter/tv_grep.PL, filter/tv_grep.in: Added two more manual
	  pages: for tv_grep and tv_extractinfo_en.  The one for tv_grep
	  was tricky because many of that command's options are
	  automatically generated from the file format description in
	  XMLTV.pm.  From now on tv_grep.in is the file to edit, and
	  tv_grep.PL processes it into the final version.  Since tv_grep.in
	  behaves just like tv_grep this should not be any great hardship.

2002-02-23 09:34  epaepa

	* Makefile.PL, t/test_filters.t: The special test case handling is
	  no longer needed, we just need to tell test_filters.t where the
	  programs and data files can be found and then we can use
	  Test::Harness as normal.

2002-02-22 11:27  epaepa

	* Makefile.PL, filter/tv_cat: Our first manual page - for tv_cat.
	  Will add manpages for all the other command-line tools soon.

2002-02-22 11:09  epaepa

	* Makefile.PL: Fixed version number in directory
	  .../share/doc/xmltv-$VERSION.

	* todo/TASKS.epa: Update on a couple of DTD controversies.

2002-02-22 10:42  epaepa

	* tv_grab_na: Changed long options to use hyphens instead of
	  underscores.

2002-02-19 23:45  jveldhuis

	* tv_grab_na: fixed usage

2002-02-19 23:42  jveldhuis

	* tv_grab_na: added options to --configure to auto answer
	  interactive questions and do things like fail with exit 1 if
	  provider changed. This is to factilitate the automatic addition
	  and removal of channels without user intervention.

2002-02-17 21:28  rmeden

	* tv_check: add device name to episode output.	change scan order
	  for conflict resolution

2002-02-14 09:42  epaepa

	* test_scripts/test_filters: Allow the directory containing filter
	  programs and the directory containing test input / output to be
	  overridden on the command line.  Remove the generated output
	  after a successful test.

2002-02-14 09:41  epaepa

	* XMLTV.pm: Better warning message when you pass in a hash with
	  undef values.

2002-02-14 07:53  epaepa

	* tv_grep: Perl's autovivification was tending to create undef hash
	  elements when tv_grep looked for things.  Rewrote the tests to be
	  more cautious and always check 'if exists $_->{whatever}' before
	  going on to perform operations on that key.  Seems to have cured
	  the problem.

2002-02-14 07:03  epaepa

	* tv_to_latex: Gave up on messing around trying to find a way to
	  convert UTF-8 to Latin-1.  We now just insist that
	  Unicode::String be available.  It was a bit pointless trying to
	  work around that one missing module when the XMLTV package
	  depends on a dozen others.  Motivated by wanting the same output
	  from tv_to_latex on every system, to pass test suite.

2002-02-14 06:56  epaepa

	* test_scripts/test_filters: More conventional Perlish interface
	  for test suite, prints 'ok X' or 'not ok X' for each test.

2002-02-14 06:39  epaepa

	* test_scripts/test_xmltv_module: Removing test_xmltv_module, it
	  has been subsumed by tv_cat.

	  cases I've been accumulating.  The new script test_filters runs
	  each filter program on each file in turn, and compares against
	  the expected result.

	  Now these expected results have not actually been checked by hand
	  - so at present all you're testing is that the behaviour hasn't
	  been changed since last time.  However I'm reasonably confident
	  that the current lot of filters work properly, so this will act
	  as a useful regression test.

	  Grabbers are harder to test, but we do have parallel_test for
	  that, it could be adapted to deal with tv_grab_na as well.  An
	  automated test for tv_check or tv_pick_cgi seems pretty difficult
	  though.

2002-02-14 05:16  epaepa

	* test_scripts/parallel_test: Added another test (channel name
	  matching), and timing both old and new versions.

2002-02-14 05:14  epaepa

	* test_data/test.xml: Fixed to conform to DTD.

2002-02-14 05:13  epaepa

	* tv_to_latex: Added --output option, required by new test suite.

2002-02-14 05:12  epaepa

	* tv_grep: Fixed argument matching and exit status.

	  (Errors revealed by test suite, which I'm about to commit.)

2002-02-13 13:08  epaepa

	* tv_grab_uk: To reduce on server load I've agreed with Ananova a
	  system to fetch multiple pages at once.  This should also make
	  tv_grab_uk a lot faster for many users.

2002-02-13 10:49  epaepa

	* tv_grab_uk: Fixed the selection of individual channels.  Also
	  noticed a design bug which makes it impossible to choose
	  individual channels if they don't have explicit XMLTV ids added.
	  Uurgh, the whole thing is so horrible...

2002-02-13 10:02  epaepa

	* tv_cat: Adding tv_cat, another filter inspired by Unix tools.
	  This one concatenates listing files.	I just wrote it as a
	  replacement for test_xmltv_module, a program which reads data
	  with XMLTV.pm and then writes it again.  This will be useful for
	  testing.

2002-02-11 10:31  epaepa

	* README: Added a list of (Perl module) dependencies.  Now README
	  and doc/QuickStart can completely replace the 'installation and
	  usage' sections of the website, which is probably a good thing
	  (info on usage belongs together with the programs themselves, and
	  should not be duplicated).

2002-02-11 09:57  epaepa

	* parallel_test, test_xmltv_module, test_scripts/README,
	  test_scripts/parallel_test, test_scripts/test_xmltv_module:
	  Tidied up the package root directory a little by moving a couple
	  of files to test_scripts/.

2002-02-11 09:53  epaepa

	* UK_TZ.pm, ZapListings.pm: Removing old versions of Perl modules
	  that have moved to the XMLTV/ directory.

2002-02-11 09:52  epaepa

	* README, doc/QuickStart, doc/coding_standards: Rewrote
	  doc/QuickStart as summary documentation for each tool.

2002-02-11 09:37  rmeden

	* README.tv_check: added html option to quick instructions

2002-02-11 08:24  epaepa

	* Ananova_Channel.pm: Removing leftover Ananova_Channel.pm, it has
	  moved to the XMLTV/ subdirectory.

2002-02-10 11:25  rmeden

	* README.tv_check: doc update for conflict checking.  also a
	  simpler quick-start guide

2002-02-10 11:01  rmeden

	* tv_check: changed hardcoded show column numbers to use names.
	  added column for recording device added conflict detection

2002-02-07 21:40  rmeden

	* tv_check: fix bug on update not updating the correct row

2002-02-07 10:31  epaepa

	* XMLTV.pm, parallel_test, test_xmltv_module, tv_grab_na,
	  tv_grab_uk, tv_sort, tv_to_latex, XMLTV/Ananova_Channel.pm,
	  XMLTV/UK_TZ.pm, XMLTV/ZapListings.pm, todo/TASKS.epa: Moved the
	  three miscellaneous Perl modules (ie, anything except XMLTV.pm)
	  into the XMLTV:: namespace and their own directory.  This is not
	  the final file reorganization, I'm just changing the code to make
	  it easier to package.

2002-02-07 04:44  epaepa

	* tv_extractinfo_en: Dealt with some false positives for children's
	  shows.

2002-02-05 22:28  rmeden

	* tv_check: Misc cleanup, improved scoping, added "use strict"

	  fixed bug/feature with length.  Blank show length now means
	  ignore length

	  added and centralized validation of fields for add/update

2002-02-05 13:49  jveldhuis

	* tv_grab_na: fixed default choice when choosing new provider
	  during --configure

2002-02-05 10:53  epaepa

	* tv_check: Okay, the Revision: line works, just making it fontify
	  correctly.

2002-02-05 10:49  epaepa

	* tv_check: Trying to fix the Revision: autoexpansion, let's see if
	  it works.

2002-02-05 10:40  jveldhuis

	* tv_grab_na: fixed missing semicolon

2002-02-05 10:00  epaepa

	* README, README.tv_check, README.tvcheck, ZapListings.pm,
	  getlistings_na, getlistings_uk_ananova, listings_to_latex,
	  parallel_test, pick_cgi, sort_listings, tv_check,
	  tv_extractinfo_en, tv_grab_na, tv_grab_uk, tv_grep, tv_pick_cgi,
	  tv_sort, tv_to_latex, tvcheck, attic/getlistings_nl,
	  attic/tv_grab_nl, doc/QuickStart, doc/tv_check_doc.html,
	  doc/tv_check_doc.jpg, doc/tvcheck_doc.html, doc/tvcheck_doc.jpg,
	  test_data/README, todo/TASKS.epa: *** Great Renaming ***

	  This is it.  All the executables should now have reasonably
	  sensible names beginning with tv_.  Grabbers begin tv_grab, tools
	  like tv_sort and tv_grep should have at least some small
	  resemblance to their Unix counterparts, and even miscellaneous
	  stuff like tv_parsedesc_en begins with the tv_ prefix so you can
	  use tab-completion easily.

	  Note, I have gone through and semi-intelligently replaced
	  occurrences of the old names.  I do not believe I have broken
	  anything.  However, I didn't test the renamed versions, because I
	  want to get this committed to CVS ASAP to avoid conflicts.  (Not
	  pretty when renamed files conflict...)

	  Please 'cvs update' and switch to the new names, I will test the
	  renamed versions and then commit any further changes needed to
	  get things working again.  If there are breakages, they will be
	  trivial and quick to mend.

	  This renaming is a precursor to making a nice tidy installer and
	  perhaps some more shuffling around of directories: but I think
	  that the renamed version as it stands now should be releasable.
	  After checking it all works, I will probably tag the tree as
	  0.4.4pre so we have something to fall back on in case we need to
	  release a new version urgently.

2002-02-05 09:18  epaepa

	* todo/TASKS.epa: Went through my inbox and noted down remaining
	  requests from users and things that need fixing.  Ouch, that's a
	  lot of tasks.

2002-02-04 11:21  epaepa

	* getlistings_uk_ananova, sort_listings, tv_extractinfo_en,
	  tv_grep: Added --output option requested by Andy B. to all
	  programs that generate XML listings.	Also a usage message where
	  one was missing.

2002-02-04 11:19  epaepa

	* todo/TASKS.epa: Update to my todo list.

2002-02-04 10:39  jveldhuis

	* doc/coding_standards: fixed Id entry

2002-02-04 10:38  jveldhuis

	* ZapListings.pm: now identifies Comedia categories in french
	  listings

2002-02-04 10:37  epaepa

	* XMLTV.pm: Corrected wrong usage example for write_data().  In
	  fact the usage of write_data() depends on the arguments to
	  construct an XMLTV::Writer, which depends on how you construct an
	  XML::Writer... but IMHO this is the least silly way to do it.

2002-02-04 10:30  epaepa

	* filter_shown: Removing filter_shown in favour of tv_grep, which
	  does the same job and more (tv_grep --on-after X == filter_shown
	  -d X).  tv_grep is 25% slower due to using XMLTV.pm rather than
	  manipulating the DOM directly, but that's not worth worrying
	  about.

2002-02-04 10:20  epaepa

	* ZapListings.pm: Turn on env_proxy flag for HTTP::Request::Common,
	  so if you have http_proxy set in your environment that proxy
	  server will be used.

	  This may cause problems for some users with dodgy proxy servers:
	  if so just unset http_proxy before running.  I thought it was not
	  working for me, but it seems to be okay now.

2002-02-04 10:05  epaepa

	* tv_extractinfo_en: Fine-tuned 'presenter' matching so that
	  'former Eurotrash presenter Jean-Paul Gaultier' is not treated as
	  the presenter of the current programme.  (The word before
	  'presenter', if any, must begin with a capital letter.)

2002-02-04 09:19  epaepa

	* tv_grep: Oops, tv_grep was stripping out channel information
	  unless some channel predicates were given to specifically include
	  it.  Changed the default to be keeping all channels unchanged if
	  no channel predicates are specified.

2002-02-02 10:05  epaepa

	* tv_grep: Implemented some suggestions from Jerry about improving
	  the usage message.

2002-02-02 09:16  epaepa

	* tv_grep: Implemented filtering on channels: two new predicates
	  --channel-name and --channel-id.  These will filter out
	  programmes like the others but also remove <channel> elements
	  from the output.

	  I believe that tv_grep now has all the functionality of Simon
	  K.'s filter, although not quite the same syntax.

2002-02-02 08:40  epaepa

	* tv_grep: Better usage message including the autogenerated
	  predicates.

2002-02-02 08:31  epaepa

	* tv_grep: Automatically generaete a long option for every key a
	  programme hash can have.  Not all these long options are usable,
	  for example there is currently no way to search on audio
	  characteristics (so using --audio will give an error message).
	  But there are searches defined for simple text, text with
	  language, and booleans, so you can say things like:

	  % tv_grep -i --category drama % tv_grep --title Countdown
	  --on-after today % tv_grep -i --new --category comedy

	  If more keys are added in the DTD and XMLTV.pm, the set of long
	  options should expand automatically.

2002-02-02 08:00  epaepa

	* tv_grep: Better argument parsing using a new OptionAbbrev class
	  which allows non-ambiguous initial substrings to be used as
	  abbreviations for long options.  So for example --o is not an
	  acceptable abbreviation, it could be short for --or or
	  --on-after.

2002-02-02 06:46  epaepa

	* XMLTV.pm: Added list_programme_keys() which allows some limited
	  querying about the data structure: what keys can be in a
	  programme, and what format their values take.  This could be
	  useful for tools which need to automatically generate code for
	  each key in turn.  I wrote it for tv_grep, so that command line
	  options like --title X or --category -X can be created
	  mechanically (and when the DTD changes, hopefully only XMLTV.pm
	  needs to be updated).

2002-02-02 06:19  epaepa

	* tv_grep: Added --or (-o) option like find(1).

2002-02-01 12:53  epaepa

	* tv_grep: Another rewrite for tv_grep.  I am trying to make it do
	  everything that Simon Kittle's 'filter' program provides.  The
	  new version of tv_grep allows boolean expressions composed with
	  'and' and 'or' in the manner of find(1) - or it will when the
	  argument parser is finished.	Currently plain regexp search,
	  --on-after, and --eval (arbitrary Perl code) are implemented.
	  Just committing what I have so far.

2002-02-01 07:40  epaepa

	* getlistings_uk_ananova, parallel_test: When I converted
	  getlistings_uk_ananova to use XMLTV.pm for output I lost the
	  timezones in the output.  This is because I forgot that the
	  XMLTV.pm data structure should contain the output form of dates
	  and times, not the Date::Manip internal form.  We need to convert
	  dates for output with date_to_uk() before storing them in the
	  programme hash, and call ParseDate() when we read from the
	  programme hash.

	  The UK listings now include timezones once more - currently 'UT'
	  for every programme, I hope it won't break when BST comes around.
	   Also committing the parallel_test setup I used to check this
	  release.

2002-01-31 12:07  epaepa

	* tv_grep: Added -e option to specify arbitrary Perl code to
	  execute on each programme (truth value returned determines
	  whether the programme is included in the output).  This is really
	  just for the infrastructure, I will later add ready-made code
	  fragments for filtering on category, date and so on.

2002-01-31 11:25  epaepa

	* tv_grep: Added --ignore-case or -i option.

2002-01-31 09:57  epaepa

	* getlistings_uk_ananova: New versions of the Memoize module
	  deprecate TIE and want HASH instead.

2002-01-31 09:56  epaepa

	* XMLTV.pm: Bugfix for writing icons.

2002-01-31 09:49  epaepa

	* test_data/README: Added comment about test data for
	  tv_extractinfo_en, which I have but cannot commit to CVS.

2002-01-31 09:46  epaepa

	* attic/: ChangeLog.old, html_parsing, misc,
	  scrapped_getlistings_uk_ananova, second_getlistings_uk_ananova,
	  test_xmltv_module: Clearing out the 'attic'.	Removed
	  Changelog.old, it was a subset of the main Changelog.old.
	  Salvaged any reusable code from the two old versions of
	  getlistings_uk_ananova into files misc and html_parsing (plus
	  tv_extractinfo_en), and removed those files.	Removed
	  test_xmltv_module, we have a working version in the main
	  directory.

2002-01-31 08:51  epaepa

	* parallel_test: Test rig I use for checking changes to
	  getlistings_uk_ananova: it runs the old version and the new
	  version with various arguments and checks the results are
	  identical.  Needs a bit of polish, but could be used for testing
	  most programs in the XMLTV distribution.

2002-01-31 08:39  epaepa

	* tv_extractinfo_en: Added tv_extractinfo_en, which reads
	  English-language programme descriptions and attempts to sniff out
	  information which could better be stored in machine-readable
	  form.  This is mostly code which used to live in the old
	  scrapped_getlistings_uk_ananova in the attic/ directory, I've
	  just ported it to the new data structures and tidied it up.

	  This sort of regular expression matching works well on the long
	  detailed descriptions Ananova provides.  It's not so good on the
	  North American listings because they have shorter descriptions.
	  But it did manage to extract the names of quiz show hosts.

2002-01-30 09:31  epaepa

	* tv_grep: First version of tv_grep, which filters particular
	  programmes from listings.  This version works by stringifying the
	  programme hash and regexp matching against that, which is kludgy
	  but effective.  Written to fill a need during debugging: more
	  fully-featured version to come later.

2002-01-30 00:09  rmeden

	* README.tvcheck, doc/tvcheck_doc.html: document the new color HTML
	  output format for a --scan

2002-01-29 23:59  rmeden

	* tvcheck: add HTML output option for color printing

2002-01-29 10:21  epaepa

	* getlistings_na: Changed quoting on Id line so it doesn't end with
	  $', which confuses XEmacs.  I apologize for having such a lame
	  editor :-(.

2002-01-29 10:18  epaepa

	* Ananova_Channel.pm, XMLTV.pm, listings_to_latex, tvcheck: Added
	  support for channel icons and URLs to XMLTV.pm.  The channels
	  data structure it returns is different (a hash mapping channel id
	  to channel hashes, rather than just lists of display-names) and
	  the interface to write_channel() has changed.  I hope I've
	  modified every program which depends on this.

2002-01-29 08:47  jveldhuis

	* ZapListings.pm: added a couple more languages I've seen.  no
	  longer print	   possible candidate for program detail we didn't
	  identify (``movie-title'') for program details that start with ``
	  and end in ''.  These seem to be related movie titles actors have
	  appeared in before.  I didn't remove them from the output before
	  this because i wanted to get a good sense of what they were
	  instead of assuming they're something we don't care about.

	  Changed all POST() calls that have empty param lists [] to GET()
	  calls instead. -- suggested by Paul Haggart <xmltv@bsfh.org>
	  (this seem to fix some proxy/firewall issues he was having, not
	  sure, but a good suggestion either way)

2002-01-29 08:39  jveldhuis

	* getlistings_na: fixed providers question so default choice works
	  if return is hit instead of re-asking the question

2002-01-29 06:30  epaepa

	* XMLTV.pm: Factored out going through @Handlers when reading a
	  <programme> element into its own subroutine call_handlers_read().
	  This is because I plan to use the same method for reading
	  channels.

2002-01-28 09:11  epaepa

	* getlistings_uk_ananova: Output categories better.  Ananova's
	  categories are 99% in English, they just need some tweaking to
	  get the coveted lang="en" certification :-).

2002-01-28 05:42  epaepa

	* XMLTV.pm: Improve checking for bad keys in hashes (to catch
	  errors when you misspell '$p{desc}' as '$p{decs}', rather than
	  silently skipping over the 'decs' key).  Keys beginning with an
	  underscore are now considered to be random junk which shouldn't
	  be written (so you can annotate programmes with whatever extra
	  information you want).

2002-01-21 09:47  epaepa

	* XMLTV.pm: The [text, language] pair returned from best_name() is
	  now one of those originally passed in (remember that these
	  anonymous pairs are passed by reference).  This means that you
	  can call best_name() on for example the descriptions of a
	  programme, find the pair you want, and modify it in-place.

2002-01-21 08:28  epaepa

	* XMLTV.pm, listings_to_latex, pick_cgi: Whoops.  A mistake in the
	  comment above best_name() caused me to implement the new return
	  value wrongly.  All human-readable text in XMLTV.pm is returned
	  as [ text, language ] pairs or maybe just [ text ].  I've
	  corrected best_name() to follow this convention.

2002-01-21 08:11  epaepa

	* XMLTV.pm, listings_to_latex, pick_cgi: Changed the behaviour of
	  best_name(), which picks the best choice for your current
	  language from a list of [language, text] pairs.  The new version
	  returns a pair [language, text], so you know what language was
	  picked.  The optional comparison function you pass in to compare
	  text strings is unchanged.

2002-01-20 23:29  rmeden

	* doc/: tvcheck_doc.html, tvcheck_doc.jpg: initial load

2002-01-20 07:55  epaepa

	* README, getlistings_uk_ananova: Updated version number to 0.4.3.

2002-01-20 07:50  epaepa

	* todo/TASKS.epa: Noticed another bug which of course I will fix at
	  the earliest opportunity (cough).

2002-01-19 21:52  rmeden

	* tvcheck: fixed bug in title chooser

2002-01-19 16:58  jveldhuis

	* getlistings_na: added --offset as per request/suggestion from
	  mielikki@users.sourceforge.net

2002-01-19 16:01  jveldhuis

	* getlistings_na: fixed carp() call when running with
	  --debuglistings enabled and a program description contains '--',
	  which is illegal in XML::Writer.

2002-01-19 15:26  jveldhuis

	* getlistings_na: usage messages now come to stdout when --help is
	  used and stderr if usage is incorrect. Also minor version number
	  is calculated from rcs id. This is minor since the version
	  information is mainly for the output 'tv' element and controling
	  the versions of xmltv_na configuration files.

2002-01-19 13:09  rmeden

	* tvcheck: Minor bug-fixes, mostly cleaning up GUI.  Added --output
	  option

2002-01-19 12:49  epaepa

	* getlistings_na: Made all grabbing error messages go to stderr
	  rather than stdout, so they don't get mixed in with the XML
	  listings.  This includes the usage message.  For consistency
	  changed the --configure usage message to stderr too.

2002-01-19 11:40  jveldhuis

	* getlistings_na: verifies provider information during configure
	  and during grab.

2002-01-19 11:38  epaepa

	* todo/TASKS.epa: Update of my task list.  This file will
	  eventually disappear completely - but not quite yet :-(.

2002-01-19 11:32  epaepa

	* getlistings_uk_ananova: Fixed selection of regions by name.
	  Dealt with FIXME for multiple descriptions - now all the
	  descriptions from Ananova are included in the output XML, with
	  the main description coming first.

2002-01-19 11:07  epaepa

	* tvcheck: Parse episode-num better.  Still not perfect, but should
	  work with files currently generated.

2002-01-19 11:05  epaepa

	* XMLTV.pm: Moved the channel writing code into a subroutine
	  write_channel() which can be called externally.  This is needed
	  for the new getlistings_uk_ananova.

2002-01-18 13:44  epaepa

	* Ananova_Channel.pm, getlistings_uk_ananova: Refactored
	  getlistings_uk_ananova's channel management into
	  Ananova_Channel.pm.  Previously there were too many hashes
	  mapping between XMLTV channel id, Ananova channel id, Ananova
	  display name (which comes in two forms), additional display name,
	  broadcast method or region, channel packages, and what the user
	  wishes to download.  It's a little bit saner now but still rather
	  ugly.

	  The Ananova_Channel package is not in any way a general or
	  reusable set of channel management routines.	It's very specific
	  to the peculiarities of this data source.  The name sucks, but
	  we're going to rename everything soon anyway.

	  Also a few bug fixes including that the episode-num is now
	  written out properly (at least until that bit of DTD gets
	  replaced with something saner), updates to channel definitions
	  and packages, and general tidying.

	  The old option ALL to get every one of Ananova's pages will
	  probably become undocumented in the next release.  It doesn't
	  work that well because often two different pages on Ananova are
	  mapped to the same XMLTV channel.  It ends up grabbing both.
	  This is however useful for checking the output, running it
	  through sort_listings to check that the two Ananova channels are
	  indeed identical, so I won't remove this ability completely.

2002-01-17 00:18  rmeden

	* README.tvcheck, tvcheck: Moved Exit button to under file menu.
	  added OnDestroy method on main app close added keyboard shortcuts
	  to menus

	  SHOW TABLE	code for minimum number of rows now works    you
	  can no longer select blank rows

	  Selection List    changed ENTRY widgets to use a --textvariable,
	  simpler code.

2002-01-15 22:50  rmeden

	* tvcheck: replace --guide paramter with --listings to match
	  getlistings_na avoid warning when no prefered language is given

2002-01-14 07:16  jveldhuis

	* getlistings_na: changed prompts for add/drop channels to have
	  'all' option.

2002-01-11 07:59  epaepa

	* README: Updated for 0.4.2.

2002-01-11 00:05  rmeden

	* tvcheck: remove debug message... oops

2002-01-10 22:37  rmeden

	* README.tvcheck: update readme to match current tvcheck version

2002-01-10 22:36  rmeden

	* tvcheck: fix the revision number in the options list

2002-01-10 22:20  rmeden

	* tvcheck:
	  changed command line options to use getopt::long, like the other
	  modules removed allchan option, now all options remove things
	  added   chanonly option to replace allchan added   neartime
	  option to include only shows within about 3 hours.  bumped
	  version number to 2.0... why.. because I deserve it!

	  and the biggie.  added --configure switch that uses TK to allow
	  you to create the shows.xml file!

2002-01-08 06:40  epaepa

	* mkdist: Added --step by step confirmation for cowardly people
	  like me.

2002-01-08 06:30  epaepa

	* pick_cgi: Finished rewriting to use XMLTV.pm.  The version
	  released with 0.4.1 didn't work at all because I forgot to copy
	  it into my CGI directory before testing.  Now writes an XML file
	  to the current directory which the user downloads normally.

2002-01-08 06:28  epaepa

	* XMLTV.pm: write_data() now takes extra arguments passed to
	  XMLTV::Writer's constructor.	This allows you to easily write
	  programmes to a different filehandle, for example.

2002-01-08 06:27  epaepa

	* attic/scrapped_getlistings_uk_ananova: Tidied by removing
	  trailing whitespace.	I'm going to remove this file soon, but in
	  the meantime I don't want it looking ugly in XEmacs :-).

2002-01-07 10:54  epaepa

	* getlistings_uk_ananova: Removed code which maintains a 'relation'
	  among programmes sharing a clump.  With the old grabber this was
	  necessary because special fixups to a programme might require
	  others in its clump to be updated.  But the special handlers are
	  no longer used (though I plan to move them into a tool of their
	  own) so there's no need to keep track of clumps beyond just
	  adding the clumpidx to each programme hash.  This is just cutting
	  out dead code.

2002-01-07 08:39  epaepa

	* attic/getlistings_na: Removing old version of getlistings_na that
	  read data from clicktv.  They have finally shut up shop and
	  started redirecting to zap2it.

2002-01-07 08:37  epaepa

	* attic/channeltest.pl: Removed test code for TVChannels module.

2002-01-07 08:36  epaepa

	* attic/TVChannels.pm: Removed old TVChannels module; its
	  functionality is provided by the XMLTV module.

2002-01-07 08:33  epaepa

	* analyse_tvprefs/analyse_tvprefs: Tidied by removing trailing
	  whitespace on comments; removed CVS logs.

2002-01-07 08:30  epaepa

	* ZapListings.pm: Tidied file by getting rid of spaces on lines
	  that were all spaces.

2002-01-07 08:27  epaepa

	* UK_TZ.pm: Tidied up file by removing trailing whitespace.

2002-01-02 21:55  rmeden

	* tvcheck: Display part x/y info stored in the "episode-num" field

2002-01-02 15:10  jveldhuis

	* getlistings_na: added --debuglistings that puts html source in
	  output listings as comments

2002-01-02 15:10  jveldhuis

	* ZapListings.pm: fixed occational problem where listings have bad
	  end-times

2002-01-02 13:47  jveldhuis

	* ZapListings.pm: added Swedish

2002-01-01 14:14  jveldhuis

	* ZapListings.pm, getlistings_na: - program titles that end in
	  'Part \d of \d' get moved   into episode-num section of programme

2002-01-01 13:22  jveldhuis

	* mkdist: better description of whats left after mkdist is run

2002-01-01 12:57  jveldhuis

	* mkdist: added comment about script should be run in an empty
	  directory

2002-01-01 12:56  jveldhuis

	* mkdist: checks and fails run if ./xmltv exists

2002-01-01 12:53  jveldhuis

	* mkdist: now warns about README contents should be updated prior
	  to mkdist now gets --sfuser from ~/.cvspass if it can instead of
	  from the command line.

2002-01-01 12:49  jveldhuis

	* README: updated README contents

2002-01-01 11:11  jveldhuis

	* mkdist: better usage

2001-12-31 16:59  epaepa

	* getlistings_uk_ananova: Updated list of 'gratis' channels based
	  on empirical evidence from Sky Digibox.  Unfortunately there are
	  still many channels which are viewable but not carried by Ananova
	  at all.  Added some error checking for the channel packages to
	  catch entry of nonexistent channels.

2001-12-31 11:25  jveldhuis

	* mkdist: new perl script version that does almost everything
	  needed to cut a release.

2001-12-31 10:39  rmeden

	* tvcheck: Pretty much a complete rewrite.  Logic reversed. Instead
	  of comparing "day" of episode data, now I convert show data to a
	  date and use that for the episode check.

	  If another episode is in a shows timeslot, details for that show
	  prints.

	  Output format now includes some episode details.

2001-12-31 09:47  jveldhuis

	* README: updated version info

2001-12-29 14:30  jveldhuis

	* ZapListings.pm: - only print 'identified possible candidate for
	  new language X in (Y-Z) if   one of Y or Z are language matches

2001-12-29 14:27  jveldhuis

	* ZapListings.pm, getlistings_na: - now when it provides a list of
	  providers the list is in the same   order as they appeared in the
	  www page. They provide the list is   a more logical order than
	  ordered by provider id.

2001-12-29 14:11  jveldhuis

	* ZapListings.pm: - added Aboriginal language - now support
	  identification of language declarations   'Hindi/Punjabi/Urdu',
	  but I'm not sure what it means

2001-12-29 13:48  jveldhuis

	* ZapListings.pm, getlistings_na: - configuration now uses channel
	  descriptions (usually   channel # and station letters) instead of
	  zap2it channel   id's.

	  - handles cable companies who have same channel id for different
	   channels in listings (have same schedule). Looks like they
	  broadcast the same channel, once in analog for peasants and
	  once in digital on two separate channels.

	  - handles cases where there seems to be two channel listings	 on
	  the same channel #. For instance in edmonton, my listings
	  currently have two channel 15s. I only get one :)

	  - this means output comes in channel description sorted order
	  instead of channel id order.

	  - automatically deals with version 1 config files with warning
	  to STDERR to re-run --configure.

	  - added ignored program details (10-1) which show up in sports
	  event   descriptions for win/loss stats.

	  - added ignored program detail (Cont'd) which seem to correlate
	  to   the music only channels where they want the listings to
	  appear every	 hour in the schedule even though the content is
	  continuous.

	  - added Oji-Cree to understood languages

2001-12-29 10:50  jveldhuis

	* getlistings_na, ZapListings.pm: - fixed some split calls where
	  the first arg was qw// instead of just   //. (thanks to Seamus
	  Venasse) - explicit about mkdir masks (using 0775 instead of
	  default 0777)

	  - fixed scraping problem where programs starting between 12pm and
	  1pm	with end times within that 12th hour we're getting adjusted
	  by 24 hour   instead of 0. - thanks Ed for this bug report.

2001-12-28 11:59  epaepa

	* README: Mentioned known bug in getlistings_na.

2001-12-28 11:33  epaepa

	* README.channels: Removed README.channels - it is obsolete now we
	  no longer have a separate channels file.  Sadly Goofy's channels
	  Perl module never got used, although XMLTV.pm provides something
	  similar.

2001-12-28 11:32  epaepa

	* getlistings_uk_ananova: Bumped version to XMLTV/0.4.

2001-12-28 11:31  epaepa

	* README: Updated README for version 0.4.

2001-12-28 10:57  epaepa

	* doc/QuickStart: Added an example of using getlistings_uk_ananova
	  to download individual channels and packages.

2001-12-28 10:56  epaepa

	* getlistings_uk_ananova: Added more fine-grained choosing of what
	  channels to download.  As well as regions you can now specify
	  channel names on the command line, or one of several hardcoded
	  channel packages.  We agreed on the mailing list that these
	  should be stored in separate files, but there isn't time to do
	  this for the 0.4 release.  (The whole directory structure needs
	  to be reorganized I think.)

2001-12-28 10:54  epaepa

	* todo/TASKS.epa: Added a few more todo-list items.

2001-12-28 09:31  jveldhuis

	* getlistings_na: changed name of config file from .config_na to
	  .xmltv_na

2001-12-28 07:48  epaepa

	* getlistings_uk_ananova: Modified not to write duplicate display
	  names for channels that appear under two different Ananova ids.

2001-12-28 07:36  epaepa

	* channels.dtd: Removing channels.dtd, it was merged into
	  xmltv.dtd.

2001-12-28 07:35  epaepa

	* todo/TASKS.epa: Added a todo item to finally write the filter /
	  searching tool discussed on the mailing list.

2001-12-28 07:34  epaepa

	* getlistings_uk_ananova: The --cache option now takes an argument
	  giving the cache filename.  Worked around an error in Ananova's
	  data.  Changed the internal names on a couple of channels to make
	  the digital and analogue versions distinct, since they differ a
	  tiny bit.

2001-12-28 07:32  epaepa

	* XMLTV.pm: Extra checking of attributes for the <programme>
	  element; added after I found I was writing 'end' instead of
	  'stop' in test cases!

2001-12-28 07:31  epaepa

	* test_data/: dups.xml, overlap.xml: A couple of test cases for the
	  new version of sort_listings.  It should correctly remove the
	  duplicates from dups.xml, and identify overlapping programmes in
	  overlap.xml.	Making these into automated tests is still todo.

2001-12-28 07:30  epaepa

	* sort_listings: Added code to remove duplicates.  This is useful
	  for Ananova's listings which give the same channel in several
	  files.  We also check to see if there are overlapping programmes
	  on the same channel (which must be wrong).

2001-12-28 04:29  epaepa

	* getlistings_uk_ananova: Bugfix: terrestrial channel codes end in
	  a digit, not begin.

2001-12-28 04:28  epaepa

	* tvcheck: Clarified usage message in comment (I hope).

2001-12-27 11:23  jveldhuis

	* ZapListings.pm: minor spelling fixes :)

2001-12-26 17:29  rmeden

	* README.tvcheck: updates to match tvhceck v1.4

2001-12-26 17:19  rmeden

	* tvcheck:
	  added anychan attribute added "sub-title" and "previously-shown"
	  to report.  added support for multiple languages changed to use
	  XMLTV.pm to read combined guide + channels.

2001-12-23 11:04  jveldhuis

	* getlistings_na: minor adjustment so we don't increment year more
	  than once on endofyear fixed

2001-12-23 11:01  jveldhuis

	* getlistings_na: now deals with cross-year listings properly.
	  Thanks to Brian J. Murrell who sent me the bug report. :)

2001-12-23 10:59  jveldhuis

	* ZapListings.pm: added Iranian to list of language identified add
	  dramma (french for drama) to items to look for.  idenfies
	  'lang-lang' program details just like (lang,lang)

2001-12-21 10:45  jveldhuis

	* getlistings_na: - default location of config file is
	  $HOME/.config_na.  - if HOME env variable not set, then
	  ./.config_na is used.  - updated usages message to reflect.

2001-12-21 07:10  epaepa

	* getlistings_uk_ananova: Moved setting $p{channel} for each
	  programme $p into get_file() where it belongs (dealt with FIXME).

2001-12-21 06:59  epaepa

	* getlistings_uk_ananova: Tidied away the ch_to_output hash so that
	  the ch_output() function is the only interface to it.

2001-12-21 06:46  epaepa

	* getlistings_uk_ananova: Just changed some comments.

2001-12-21 06:37  epaepa

	* getlistings_uk_ananova: Redid <video> and <audio> handling; now
	  if a programme is on a radio station we know that it has no
	  picture and does have sound (this deals with one FIXME).  Also if
	  a TV programme is stereo we know it has sound; if it's
	  black-and-white we know it has a picture.  Unfortunately we don't
	  get enough information to say for sure whether these things are
	  part of all programmes.  Fortunately the file format allows
	  'yes', 'no' - or missing for 'don't know'.

	  Cut down on bad date warnings when you're using the cache.

2001-12-20 23:14  rmeden

	* README.tvcheck: changed TVCHECK to "tvcheck" for correctness

2001-12-19 10:19  epaepa

	* xmltv.dtd: Bumped version number reflecting the inclusion of
	  channels; allowed channels to have icons.

2001-12-19 09:47  epaepa

	* getlistings_uk_ananova: Explicitly set Date::Manip's timezone so
	  it should work on Windows.

2001-12-19 09:07  epaepa

	* todo/TASKS.epa: Ticked off a couple of todo list items.

2001-12-19 09:06  epaepa

	* listings_to_latex: Removed confusing reference to
	  Lingua::Preferred (it's no longer called directly); added comment
	  warning about tmpnam() insecurity (but didn't bother to actually
	  fix the problem).

2001-12-19 09:05  epaepa

	* getlistings_uk_ananova: Fixed yet another [ text, lang ] bug;
	  reinstated memoization of date routines to get a small speedup;
	  added special-case code to avoid warning about a known
	  inconsistency ('Nickelodeon') in Ananova's data.

2001-12-19 08:10  epaepa

	* getlistings_uk_ananova: Removed the 'FIXME temporary speedup' and
	  replaced it with a --cache option to help debugging.	Adjusted
	  the (rather pointless) daytime/evening/latenight check to cope
	  with a 23:59 programme which Ananova classes as 'latenight'.

2001-12-19 05:27  epaepa

	* XMLTV.pm, listings_to_latex, pick_cgi: Both listings_to_latex and
	  pick_cgi had code to select one title (or description, etc) from
	  a list of several according to language and other factors.  I've
	  commonized this code into a routine best_name() in XMLTV.pm,
	  which chooses the best piece of text by first finding those that
	  are preferred because of their language, and if there is more
	  than one in this list, choosing between them based on which
	  appears first in the XMLTV file or based on a user-supplied
	  comparator.  listings_to_latex passes in a function which chooses
	  the shorter of two titles.  This might not work when none of the
	  available languages matches what's accepted by the user, should
	  test that.

	  Also modified pick_cgi to use XMLTV.pm instead of XML::Simple.

2001-12-19 05:21  epaepa

	* getlistings_uk_ananova: Fixed language-undefined bug where the [
	  text, lang ] pair was the wrong way round.  Hopefully I've now
	  eliminated all of these and standardized on putting text first
	  and (optionally) language second.

2001-12-16 22:08  rmeden

	* README.tvcheck: Initial load of README file for tvcheck

2001-12-16 19:51  rmeden

	* tvcheck: another attempt at the ID line.. maybe I should read the
	  manual

2001-12-16 19:47  rmeden

	* tvcheck: attempt to add version line

2001-12-13 17:05  jveldhuis

	* ZapListings.pm: - added a couple more languages

	  - now properly identifies subtitle declarations like:   "X and Y
	  subtitles"   "X with Y subtitles"   "X; Y subtitles"	 "X, Y
	  subtitles"   "X/Y subtitles"

	  - identifies dubbed declarations like   "X/Y"   "X,Y"   "X and Y"
	    "X with Y"

2001-12-13 17:05  jveldhuis

	* getlistings_na:
	  - added --output synonym for --listings to command line options

	  - --listings argument can also contain '%postalcode' or
	  '%zipcode'   which gets substituted based on configuration. This
	  allows   you to defined output files such as
	  %postalcode-%d%m%Y.xml   for instance.

	  - makes all missing directories to --listings output file.
	  This allows for --listings %d%m%Y/listings.xml

	  - now dubbed programmes include both 'orig-language' and
	  'language'   elements

2001-12-12 17:02  jveldhuis

	* getlistings_na: updated minor version #

2001-12-12 17:01  jveldhuis

	* getlistings_na: now attempts to deal with channels in channel #
	  order

2001-12-12 15:06  jveldhuis

	* getlistings_na: - should now conforms to new xmltv.dtd
	  (although I havn't run any output through a DOM parser)

	  - deprecated --programs and --channels as command line options
	  and added --listings

2001-12-12 14:28  jveldhuis

	* getlistings_na, ZapListings.pm: - added requirement for LWP 5.62
	  or later.  - added some new languages I found during overnight
	  use - fixed incorrect warnings about possibly missing program
	  details that appear in () but in the middle of the   program
	  descriptions.  - added check for some categories like (fiction)
	  (drama) that	 appear at the end of the program description
	  instead of   where the rest of the categories appear at the
	  beginning   of the program description.  - removed 'use
	  diagnositics' - --configure is interactive so I added a splash
	  screen with	a welcome message and version information that
	  might be   helpful down the road when doing problem diagnosis.

2001-12-11 11:18  epaepa

	* XMLTV.pm, ZapListings.pm, filter_shown, getlistings_na,
	  getlistings_uk_ananova, listings_to_latex, pick_cgi,
	  sort_listings, test_xmltv_module, xmltv.dtd,
	  attic/test_xmltv_module, doc/grabber_interface, test_data/README,
	  test_data/sort.xml, test_data/test.xml, test_data/test_livre.xml,
	  todo/TASKS.epa: Merged together the channels.dtd and xmltv.dtd
	  file formats, so a single XML file gives both programmes and
	  channels (with channels listed first).  This has meant changing
	  most programs which read or write these formats (although the old
	  tv.xml files will continue to work).	I took the opportunity to
	  rewrite XMLTV.pm so it inputs and outputs all the different parts
	  of the file format, although I'll probably need to rewrite it
	  again for speed.

	  XMLTV.pm now provides read_data() and write_data() routines which
	  deal with credits, channels and programmes in one go.  For lazy
	  writing of programmes you can use the XMLTV::Writer interface.

	  Getlistings_uk_ananova needed changing to handle the fact that
	  channels are written in the same file and _before_ any programe
	  details.  Also for the new cleaned-up XMLTV.pm interface which
	  insists on multivalued [ text, language ] pairs.  Added some new
	  channels which have appeared in the UK since the last update.

	  Listings_to_latex and sort_listings were rewritten to use
	  XMLTV.pm instead of XML::DOM.

	  Pick_cgi is probably *BROKEN* although I have made some fixes for
	  multivalued text-with-language.  I will fix it ASAP, I just
	  didn't want to wait any longer to get code out there.

	  Fixes to getlistings_na to comply with the old file format - but
	  _not_ yet to write channels and programmes in the same file.
	  That is still todo.

	  Small fixes to ZapListings.pm - not related to the xmltv.dtd
	  reorganization.

	  Added some test files and a test_xmltv_module program (which
	  should behave like cat(1) if the code is correct), but a proper
	  automated test suite remains to be done.

2001-12-04 18:29  jveldhuis

	* getlistings_na, ZapListings.pm: properly identifies:	 -
	  programme star ratings   - programme subtitles (include language
	  of subtitles as well)   - programme languages   - programme
	  ratings (MPAA, ESRB and VCHIP)   - fixed bug where dataElement
	  was called with one argument	 - better identification of valid
	  programme details   - better identification of possible updates
	  to identifiable     details list (ie new languages found)

	  properly identifies channels commented out of config file.

	  identifies and skips channels that are no longer available, but
	  appear in config file.

2001-11-28 23:15  rmeden

	* tvcheck: Initial load of tvcheck

2001-11-27 14:22  jveldhuis

	* mkdist: no longer ship Changelog.old

2001-11-24 15:27  jveldhuis

	* mkdist: no longer removes CVS dirs to tag can be done before tar

	* doc/QuickStart: Added QuickStart doc from 0.3 release.

2001-11-23 17:12  jveldhuis

	* ZapListings.pm: 1. Fixed problems with cookies not getting set on
	  redirects.	 We now set the cookie_jar with the UserAgent and
	  the cookies	  get set automatically prior to requests.

	  2. dumpPage now increments counter so filenames actually change
	  :)

2001-11-22 11:24  epaepa

	* doc/coding_standards: Briefly explained the criteria I use for
	  adding features to the file format.

2001-11-21 13:42  jveldhuis

	* ZapListings.pm: increase in speed (my tests say 2 fold) with
	  cookie magic

2001-11-20 22:52  jveldhuis

	* todo/TASKS.epa: updated todo list removing "done" items
	  associated with me

2001-11-20 22:48  jveldhuis

	* ZapListings.pm, getlistings_na:
	  configure - now should work if you provide postal/zip code and
	  provider id		  on command line, cookie problems
	  prevented this from working.

	  grab - every grab starts off with warnings about new or missing
	  channels	  icons are grabbed from grid page to fill in
	  'icon' entries compliant	  with channels.dtd

2001-11-20 15:37  jveldhuis

	* xmltv.dtd: fixed id keyword

2001-11-20 08:25  jveldhuis

	* xmltv.dtd: added icon elements to programmes, ratings and
	  star-ratings

2001-11-20 08:24  jveldhuis

	* channels.dtd: added icon elements to channels

2001-11-20 08:13  epaepa

	* getlistings_uk_ananova: Moved the code to generate the hash of
	  channels into its own subroutine, channels_output().	The whole
	  thing is still a bit of a mess though.

2001-11-20 07:40  epaepa

	* getlistings_uk_ananova: Tidied up trailing spaces on comment
	  lines.  XEmacs flags them and they are kinda pointless, I've
	  decided.

2001-11-15 10:50  epaepa

	* ZapListings.pm: Removed _getChannelsList(), a subroutine which is
	  never called.  Probably it was some older version of the code.
	  Now we have CVS there's less need for that.

	  Created dumpPage(), a routine which makes a 'core dump' of an
	  HTML page for debugging.  This could probably replace existing
	  code to write out page content, if Jerry agrees.

	  Fixed channel-selection bug with some providers by making the
	  regexp more liberal.

2001-11-14 17:02  jveldhuis

	* ZapListings.pm, getlistings_na: fixed bug - looks like prototypes
	  don't  always work

2001-11-14 10:33  jveldhuis

	* getlistings_na: default --days is now 7 instead of 1

2001-11-14 10:13  jveldhuis

	* ZapListings.pm, getlistings_na: removed support for --startHour
	  and --endHour

2001-11-14 09:32  epaepa

	* README, ZapListings.pm, getlistings_na: New README / release
	  notes for 0.3 release.  Removed Beer-ware, we are now pure GPL
	  (but of course contributors are free to license their code under
	  other terms as well).

2001-11-14 09:31  epaepa

	* mkdist: Updated for move from RCS to CVS: you have to update the
	  ChangeLog manually (probably by running cvs2cl) before running
	  mkdist.

2001-11-14 09:15  epaepa

	* README, getlistings_uk_ananova: Bumped version number to 0.3,
	  reflecting new _na grabber.

2001-11-14 08:59  epaepa

	* getlistings_uk_ananova: Give a friendly(ish) usage message for
	  the --help option.

2001-11-14 06:47  epaepa

	* doc/coding_standards: Added guidelines for commenting
	  subroutines.

2001-11-13 13:46  jveldhuis

	* getlistings_na: removes white space from postal code

2001-11-13 07:53  epaepa

	* ZapListings.pm: Fixed date format (YYYY-MM-DD).

2001-11-13 06:53  epaepa

	* listings_to_latex: Quote characters better for LaTeX output - in
	  particular that broken-vertical-bar character appearing
	  mysteriously in some Spanish listings.

2001-11-12 15:46  jveldhuis

	* README, UK_TZ.pm, XMLTV.pm, ZapListings.pm, channels.dtd,
	  getlistings_na, getlistings_uk_ananova, listings_to_latex,
	  mkdist, pick_cgi, sort_listings, xmltv.dtd, README.channels,
	  filter_shown: removed \$Log entries as per xmltv-devel mailing
	  list discussion

2001-11-12 10:25  jveldhuis

	* getlistings_na: removed unneeded '&Date::Manip::' prefixes to
	  those subroutine calls.  with exception to unexported Date_Split
	  call.

	  fixed when new programs file is initialized.	not supports
	  emitting program 'previously-shown' attr.

2001-11-12 10:23  jveldhuis

	* ZapListings.pm: 'Repeat' in details now comes out as
	  'previously-shown' attr of program fixed some STDERR status
	  messages

2001-11-11 15:30  jveldhuis

	* ChangeLog.old, README, README.channels, UK_TZ.pm, XMLTV.pm,
	  channels.dtd, filter_shown, getlistings_uk_ananova,
	  listings_to_latex, mkdist, pick_cgi, sort_listings, xmltv.dtd,
	  doc/coding_standards: added \$Id \$ as approprate

2001-11-11 15:29  jveldhuis

	* ZapListings.pm: messages go to stderr, both status and debugging.
	   error messages or warnings try and include html that caused
	  failure.

	  acknowledges program detail 'AO' although I don't know what it
	  means exactly. Maybe adults only, but not part of any standard,
	  so we scrape and ignore.

	  how print STDERR message for each station page scraped to get
	  more feed back to user something is happening.

2001-11-11 15:26  jveldhuis

	* getlistings_na: now only writes channels file when approprate so
	  only writes is out every day if you've specified a filename that
	  contains imbedded date information, same as with programs
	  filenames.

	  prints summary statistics about how much and how fast the grabber
	  was

2001-11-11 15:18  jveldhuis

	* getlistings_ca, ClickListings.pm: no longer supported, use _na
	  for ca listings

2001-11-11 11:04  epaepa

	* doc/coding_standards: Added coding standards document, prompted
	  by my edict on the mailing list about the format of CVS log
	  messages.  Of course I will now look really silly if I fail to
	  follow the guidelines I wrote :-).

2001-11-11 10:49  epaepa

	* ZapListings.pm: Fixed a couple of syntax errors (don't know
	  whether I caused them last time).

2001-11-11 10:04  epaepa

	* ClickListings.pm: Changed a lot of 'print STDERR' to 'warn', it
	  makes it clearer what the purpose is.  Debug statements didn't
	  change since they're not actually warnings.

2001-11-11 09:44  epaepa

	* ClickListings.pm, README, README.channels, UK_TZ.pm, XMLTV.pm,
	  ZapListings.pm, channels.dtd, filter_shown, getlistings_ca,
	  getlistings_na, getlistings_uk_ananova, listings_to_latex,
	  mkdist, pick_cgi, sort_listings, xmltv.dtd,
	  analyse_tvprefs/analyse_tvprefs: Whoops, just realized that the
	  last changelog message would itself get keyword-expanded, causing
	  no end of confusion.	I had to perform some emergency censorship
	  of funny dollar signs.

2001-11-11 09:41  epaepa

	* ClickListings.pm, README, README.channels, UK_TZ.pm, XMLTV.pm,

	  getlistings_na, getlistings_uk_ananova, listings_to_latex,
	  mkdist, pick_cgi, sort_listings, xmltv.dtd,
	  analyse_tvprefs/analyse_tvprefs: Rearranged (or added) comments
	  at the start of each file, so the description is near the top and
	  the changelog near the bottom.  Added $Log: $ lines to get an
	  automatically updated changelog from now on; I hope it works.

2001-11-11 08:57  epaepa

	* ChangeLog.old: Added the RCS version history (from rcs2log) to
	  ChangeLog.old.  From now on we will not edit a ChangeLog file,
	  all changes will be logged with CVS commit messages.

	  Still, I said the same thing when I moved to RCS - so perhaps we
	  will be doing this again in a year or so when we abandon CVS for
	  something else :-).

2001-11-11 08:51  epaepa

	* attic/rcs.tar: Adding a tarball of the old RCS repository.  This
	  is just in case we need to dig out version history from before
	  CVS.	I don't expect we shall.

2001-11-11 08:43  epaepa

	* attic/: ChangeLog.old, TVChannels.pm, channels_nl.xml,
	  channeltest.pl, getlistings_na, getlistings_nl,
	  scrapped_getlistings_uk_ananova, second_getlistings_uk_ananova,
	  test_xmltv_module: Adding the attic/ directory to CVS.

	  If we were starting from scratch with CVS I wouldn't do this; you
	  should just 'cvs remove' things that are no longer needed.
	  However we're importing an existing set of files and I just want
	  to make sure that these files are included in the repository.
	  Some of them are still useful; in particular,
	  scrapped_getlistings_uk_ananova has some semi-useful HTML parsing
	  code and second_getlistings_uk_ananova attempts to parse English
	  programme descriptions and generate metadata.  Both of these
	  could be salvaged and made into separate tools.

2001-11-11 08:37  epaepa

	* mkdist: Adding one remaining file from the old working/
	  directory: mkdist.  This is a quick and dirty shell script to
	  make a tarball of the current version.  I haven't tested that it
	  works with CVS working copies, that'll come when I make the next
	  release later today (I hope).

2001-11-11 08:35  epaepa

	* listings_to_latex: Moved prototypes higher up the file, so they
	  are seen by perl before any of the functions are called.  This
	  stops the annoying warnings under newer perls.

2001-11-11 08:34  epaepa

	* getlistings_uk_ananova: Added more prototype declarations to
	  avoid warnings under perl 5.6 (and to make the prototype checking
	  actually work, in fact).

	  Don't warn more than once for channel ids without a valid region
	  (caused by occasional strangeness at Ananova's end).

2001-11-11 08:21  epaepa

	* ChangeLog: Removing ChangeLog file; it was generated
	  automatically from RCS and will not be kept up to date with CVS
	  commits.  I plan to make a ChangeLog.old with announcements from
	  the RCS days and before; then whenever we make a release tarball
	  the ChangeLog file can be generated from the CVS logs.  It is not
	  itself kept in CVS.

2001-11-11 08:18  epaepa

	* towatch.dvi: Removing towatch.dvi, another old personal file from
	  working/.

2001-11-11 08:17  epaepa

	* cgi/: .htaccess, pick.cgi, towatch, tvprefs, tvprefs.old:
	  Removing cgi/ directory: this was just for my personal use and
	  doesn't belong in CVS.

2001-11-08 23:48  jveldhuis

	* ZapListings.pm, getlistings_na: minor adjustments

2001-11-08 23:25  jveldhuis

	* ZapListings.pm, getlistings_na:
	  Heres the beta version of the grabber for zap2it.com I went with
	  a slightly different approach to how to set things up.

	  There is a '--configure' command line arg that walks you through
	  the required sets for setting it up.

	  It will prompt you for a postal/zip code, let you choose from the
	  list of service providers in your area, then let you choose what
	  channels you want.  All of of the info collected during
	  --configure is saved in a config file (./.config_na by default)
	  and is used to when grabbing listings. All of this gets us around
	  the registration normally required by the site. The integration
	  is probably easily broken, so keep me posted on what you get for
	  errors.

	  You should read the 'known bugs' list in the top of the
	  getlistings_na file.

	  Please, please criticize to developers mailings list.

	  Otherwise, happy hunting.

2001-11-08 23:18  jveldhuis
